## Overview 

Carpentries Instructor Training provides strategies to teach coding and data workshops. Our 16-hour interactive training teaches the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. During the training, you will practise these new skills while getting to know others who share your interests. After the training, you can become a Certified Carpentries Instructor by completing three “checkout” steps. Certified Instructors can volunteer to teach our “Centrally-Organised workshops” with our global community virtually or in-person. Additionally, they can organise Carpentries workshops for their local community.

    - You may receive an invitation via email from a member organisation or other group that has arranged for training.
    - Purchase an individual Instructor Training seat. Review [our pricing](/support/pricing#instructor-training-pricing) and  [contact us](mailto:{{< param team_email >}}) to purchase a seat.
1. Complete Certification Steps: You must complete three short tasks after the training in order to complete certification as a Carpentries Instructor. See our [Checkout Instructions page]({{< param checkout_instructions >}}) for more details.
