## Overview 

Carpentries Instructor Training gives you strategies to teach coding and data workshops. Our 16-hour hands-on training teaches the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. During the training, you will practise these new skills while getting to know others who share your interests.
After the training, you may complete three "checkout" steps to become a Certified Carpentries Instructor. Certified Instructors can volunteer to teach at our "centrally-organised workshops" with our global community virtually or in-person. They are also able to organise Carpentries workshops for their local community.

## How To Become An Instructor


The Carpentries workshops are taught by trained and certified volunteer Instructors. Certified Carpentries Instructors can Self-Organise workshops at home or volunteer to join a workshop at another site through our Centrally-Organised workshops program. We match our Instructors with teaching opportunities that fit their schedules, travel interests, and availability. We have held workshops in over 40 countries on every continent (including Antarctica!).
This is how you can become a Certified Instructor:
1. Get Invited or Accepted: There are two ways to access Instructor Training. Apply and be accepted to our Open Instructor Training Program. Optionally, you may receive an invitation via email from a member organisation or other group that has arranged for training.
1. Attend An Instructor Training Event: The 16-hour training runs over two full days or four half days and covers the basics of educational psychology, evidence-based classroom practices, and how to apply both to teaching workshops for The Carpentries.
1. Complete Certification Steps: After the training, you will be asked to complete 3 checkout steps: Attend a discussion session where you can ask questions about teaching and learn from other instructors; Complete a teaching demonstration, which is a group practice session where you will demonstrate 5-minutes of teaching and receive feedback; and contribute to a Carpentries Lesson. See our [Checkout Instructions page]({{< param checkout_instructions >}}) for more details.
