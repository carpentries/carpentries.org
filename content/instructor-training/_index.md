## Overview 

Carpentries Instructor Training provides strategies to teach coding and data workshops. Our 16-hour interactive training teaches the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. During the training, you will practise these new skills while getting to know others who share your interests. After the training, you can become a Certified Carpentries Instructor by completing three “checkout” steps. Certified Instructors can volunteer to teach our “Centrally-Organised workshops” with our global community virtually or in-person. Additionally, they can organise Carpentries workshops for their local community.
