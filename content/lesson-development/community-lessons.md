The Carpentries community is committed to a collaborative and open process for lesson development and to sharing teaching materials. We provide two avenues for community members to share lesson materials - [The Carpentries Incubator]({{< param incubator_link >}}) and [The Carpentries Lab]({{< param lab_link >}}).

The Carpentries Incubator is for:

- Collaborative lesson development (from conceptual to stable lessons).
- Providing visibility for lessons that are being worked on.

The Carpentries Lab is for:

- Peer-reviewed, short-format, lessons that use the teaching approach and lesson design from The Carpentries.
- [Submitting lessons for peer-review](https://github.com/carpentries-lab/reviews/) in a way traditional journal peer-review would not be able to provide.

[More information about The Carpentries Incubator, The Carpentries Lab, and how the table below is built is available at the end of this page](#the-carpentries-incubator)

## The Carpentries Incubator

[The Carpentries Incubator]({{< param incubator_link >}}) is a place for Carpentries community members to share Carpentries-style teaching materials at all stages of development, to collaborate on lesson development, and receive feedback from other community members.

Lessons in The Carpentries Incubator are developed and supported by community members and are not officially endorsed by The Carpentries. We encourage you to browse the Incubator lessons for materials that meet your needs and to use these materials freely (all lessons are [licensed CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)). However, we are unable to offer workshops teaching these lessons upon request.

If you are interested in developing or submitting a lesson, please visit
[the Proposals repository for The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals#readme). Please read the information on [our Development of Lessons page](/involved-lessons/) if you would like to contribute to the development of a lesson already present
in The Carpentries Incubator. You can also find [a list of issues in need of attention on the Help Wanted page](/lessons/help_wanted/).

## The Carpentries Lab

[The Carpentries Lab]({{< param lab_link >}}) is a place for sharing high-quality, peer-reviewed lessons that follow best practices in pedagogy and the general teaching practices used in Carpentries workshops.

Lessons in The Carpentries Lab have been peer-reviewed and are vetted by The Carpentries as high-quality resources. We encourage you to browse the Lab lessons for materials that meet your needs and to use these materials freely (all lessons are licensed [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)). However, we are unable to offer workshops teaching these lessons upon request.

While we pilot our review process, we can commit only to review lessons that have been invited to submit to The Carpentries Lab. Authors who have not been invited may still submit a lesson for review, but can expect some delay in the processing of their request. For more information about The Carpentries Lab and the open peer review process, please visit [the reviews repository](https://github.com/carpentries-lab/reviews/).

## Information for Lesson Developers

The table on this page is created based on the [topic annotations on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)
in The Carpentries Incubator and Carpentries Lab. If you are developing a lesson in the Incubator but do not see it listed above, check that your lesson repository has topic tags assigned, _including the "lesson" tag_.  Topics can be added to a lesson repository by editing the repository _About_ box, near the top right of the repository homepage interface. More guidance for adding topics to a lesson repository is provided in [an appendix to The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html#topic-tags). Changes to the lesson repository may take several hours to be updated on this page.

If you have added the appropriate topics on your lesson repository and it
still does not appear in the table above, please contact the Incubator team at [{{< param incubator_email >}}](mailto:{{< param incubator_email >}}).
