The Carpentries hosts a thriving curriculum development community. Lesson developers collaborate on new lessons in [The Carpentries Incubator]({{< param incubator_link >}}). Mature lessons can be submitted for open peer review in [The Carpentries Lab]({{< param lab_link >}}) and/or may be adopted by one of our lesson programs.

The successful design and collaborative development of a new lesson or curriculum requires specialised knowledge and skills. The [Carpentries Collaborative Lesson Development Training](#about-the-training) provides our community members with the expertise they need to co-create a high-quality curriculum.

The Lesson Developer Handbook provides detailed information, resources, and other documentation for community members who want to get involved with curriculum development.


## Collaborative Lesson Development Training

Collaborative Lesson Development Training teaches essential skills
and good practices for designing and developing a lesson as an open source project. The training will guide you through the design process and initial development of a new lesson, prepare you to work with the infrastructure we use to build accessible, open-source lesson websites, and provide some advice and techniques for effective collaboration on the project.

### Target audience

Collaborative Lesson Development Training is aimed at Carpentries community members who have an idea for a new lesson and want to begin developing it into an open source lesson website, in collaboration with others. [The curriculum]({{< param cldt_curriculum >}}) was developed with a focus on lessons for short-format training (e.g. two-day workshops), but most of the skills and principles taught apply to all curriculum designs.

### What will you learn?
The training teaches fundamental concepts, skills, and good practice in three key areas:

* Lesson design and development
* Collaboration
* Using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

- collaboratively develop and publish lessons using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
- identify and characterise the target audience for a lesson
- define SMART learning objectives
- explain the pedagogical value of authentic tasks
- create exercises for formative assessment
- explain how considerations of cognitive load should influence - the pacing, length, and organisation of a lesson
- use best practices to configure and maintain accessible and - usable lesson repositories that are readily available for collaboration
- identify and correct accessibility issues in a lesson built on The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
- use feedback and reflection from teaching to update and improve lesson material
- review and provide constructive feedback on lessons

### Training structure
The training takes place in two parts, separated by an extended break where participants test their new lessons.

In the first part, trainees will learn about backward lesson design, including techniques for the development of effective exercises and accessible lesson content. Trainees will define the target audience and intended learning outcomes of their lesson, produce an outline of the lesson content and narrative, and prepare exercises and examples for a chosen section. They will also be introduced to [The Carpentries Workbench]({{< param workbench_link >}}), the infrastructure that the community uses to create lessons. Applying these skills as they learn, trainees will begin building their new material into an open source lesson website.

Trainees will trial part of their new lesson with a real audience during the break between this first part and the conclusion of the training, using this opportunity to gather vital feedback on their lesson design.

When they return for the second and final part of the training, trainees will reflect on this experience and discuss how to approach the remaining stages of lesson development. In the concluding stages of the training,  trainees will learn principles and practices to ensure they can continue to collaborate effectively on the project.
