{{< accordion title="What are the standard membership packages you offer?" >}}
We offer Bronze, Silver, and Gold membership packages, each with an allotted number of Centrally-Organised [workshops](/workshops).
Silver and Gold memberships also include seats in our [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)
program. Platinum memberships include Instructor Training seats, but no Centrally-Organised workshops. All memberships include unlimited
Self-Organised workshops and access to Member pricing for additional Centrally-Organised workshops and Instructor Training seats purchased during the membership year. Read more about the benefits and dues for each plan on our [membership](/membership) page.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Which membership should I purchase?" >}}
* <b>Bronze membership</b> is an excellent option for any organisation starting out with The Carpentries and wanting to quickly bring data and computational training to their community. The Bronze level is also great for introducing your local community to The Carpentries and building interest for Instructor Training.
* <b>Silver and Gold memberships</b> are ideal for organisations wanting to quickly build capacity for training in their community.
* <b>Platinum memberships</b> are best for organisations that would like to continue building capacity for training and already have a group of local Carpentries Instructors capable of running Self-Organised workshops.
* <b>Titanium memberships</b> are suited for organisations who do not need coordinated workshops or Instructor Training seats but would
like to maintain their membership status, financially support The Carpentries, and connect with other Members. To be eligible for
Titanium membership, organisations must have at least one prior year of membership.<br><br>
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What if those membership packages do not fit my institution’s needs?" >}}
We would be happy to talk with you to learn more about your institution’s goals and create a custom plan that works for you.  Contact our membership team to schedule a meeting at [{{< param membership_email >}}](mailto:{{< param membership_email >}}).
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Do I need to renew my membership each year?" >}}
Yes. The Carpentries memberships are annual memberships, extending for a period of one year. Renewing your membership in advance is a great way to avoid a lapse in membership.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Are any discounts available?" >}}
Organisations supporting [Instructor Trainers]({{< param handbook_url >}}/handbooks/instructor_trainers.html#roles-and-responsibilities), who engage in
service activities to teach and support newly trained Instructors across our global community, may be eligible for a discount to their membership fee
equivalent to six (6) seats in Instructor Training per active Instructor Trainer. Members can choose whether they would like to have the Trainer discount applied as a monetary discount or as added benefits.  This discount is available at any membership level, for each trainer who has participated in the following up to 1 year prior to renewal:
* teach at least two (2) Instructor Training events for the global Carpentries community.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How can I find out if my institution already has a membership?" >}}
A list of our [current Member organisations](/members/) can be found on our website. If you would like

## Workshops


{{< accordion title="What is the difference between a Centrally-Organised workshop and a Self-Organised workshop?" >}}
For a Centrally-Organised workshop, The Carpentries Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) will recruit Instructors, set up registration, and provide additional support while planning workshops. A Self-Organised workshop is planned independently of WIT, which means the host is connected with our [certified Instructors](/community/instructors/) and will work with them on all aspects of workshop organisation. Self-organised workshops are free of charge. However, if you need AWS instances for Genomics Self-organised or Centrally-organised workshops, additional fees apply. Please refer to the [Genomics Workshops Terms of Agreement]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/workshops/genomics_policy.html) for additional information. Please visit our [Host a Workshop page](/workshops/host-workshop/) to learn more about both workshop types.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do your workshops run?" >}}
For [Centrally-Organised workshops](/workshops/#workshop-organising), we will work with a designated Member contact to find
Instructors, set up and handle registration, support Instructor logistics, and coordinate and share assessment results with you.
Instructor travel expenses are the responsibility of the Member and are not covered in membership fees.<br><br>
Centrally-Organised workshops can also be purchased [a la carte](/support/pricing/#workshop-pricing) or added to an existing
membership. If you would like to run a Centrally-Organised workshop in order to demonstrate the value of The Carpentries
membership at your organisation, we will count the workshop fee towards a membership if purchased within twelve (12) months.<br><br>
Workshops can cover curricula from any of our lesson programs: [Data Carpentry]({{< param dc-website >}}lessons), [Library Carpentry]({{< param dc-website >}}lessons), or [Software Carpentry]({{< param dc-website >}}lessons).  An overview of available workshops is located on our [curricula page](/lessons/curriculum-summary/). Contact us at [{{< param workshops_email >}}](mailto:{{< param workshops_email >}}) to learn more about our workshop operations.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How soon after signing my membership can I get started with hosting workshops?" >}}
Right away! You can request workshops as soon as your membership agreement is in place by completing [this form]({{< param amy_workshop_landing >}}). To allow us time to recruit Instructors and give them time to plan the workshop with you, we generally require 2-3 months lead time to schedule a workshop.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Can I run my own workshops without organisational support from The Carpentries?" >}}
Yes! Once you start building a team of certified Instructors, you can work with them to run Self-Organised workshops. We ask that Instructors let us know when they are planning a Self-Organised workshop in advance by completing this [form]({{< param amy_workshop_landing >}}). This form initiates a process so that The Carpentries staff can support the workshop by providing survey links, tracking Instructor and Helper participation, and publicising the workshop on The Carpentries websites, if desired. As long as at least one Instructor is Carpentries-certified, and either the Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry core content is taught, the workshop can be labeled a Carpentries workshop. Self-Organised workshops do not count against the number of workshops included in your membership agreement and there is no limit to the number of Self-Organised workshops you can run.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What if I want to run more Centrally-Organised workshops than my agreement allows?" >}}
All members are eligible to purchase additional Centrally-Organised workshops at a discount.
Our current [pricing is here](/support/pricing/#workshop-pricing).
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do I request a Centrally-Organised Workshop?" >}}
Planning a successful Carpentries workshop starts with selecting the right curriculum for your audience. Review the available [curricula](/lessons/curriculum-summary/) to determine which lessons best align with your learners' needs. Once you've identified the most suitable curriculum, choose potential workshop dates at least 10 weeks in advance to allow ample time for preparation, Instructor recruitment, and logistical arrangements. After finalising the details, complete and submit the [Workshop Request Form]({{< param amy_req_cow >}}) to initiate the official workshop request process. 
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Do I need to notify The Carpentries about Self-Organised Workshops?" >}}
Yes, complete the [self-organised workshop form]({{< param amy_reg_sow >}}) so the workshop can be listed on our website, and you can receive the necessary resources and support.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What happens if I need to cancel or postpone a planned workshop?" >}}
If you need to cancel your workshop, please inform the Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) by emailing [{{< param workshops_email >}}](mailto:{{< param workshops_email >}}). The WIT member you have been working with will ensure that the workshop is removed from The Carpentries website and complete any other administrative tasks associated with it.

If you need to postpone your workshop, please email [{{< param workshops_email >}}](mailto:{{< param workshops_email >}}). The WIT member you have been working with will help you select new dates and complete any other administrative tasks associated with the workshop. Please ensure that you inform your registrants of a cancelled or postponed workshop via email or through your registration platform.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do I obtain survey data or links for previous workshops?" >}}
The Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) can provide survey result links for past workshops (August 2018 - present) to Instructors and hosts that either taught at, hosted the workshop, or a programmatic contact to a members organisation (see Membership Management). To request survey results links, please send an email to WIT (via [{{< param workshops_email >}}](mailto:{{< param workshops_email >}})) with your request and include a link to the workshop website(s) and/or slug(s).
{{< /accordion >}}

## Instructor Training

{{< accordion title="How do your Instructor Training events run?" >}}
The Carpentries [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) is a high-engagement, interactive,
multi-day training, led by pedagogically trained community members (Trainers). Once your membership is in place, you will be
provided with a registration code which your selected trainees can use to register for an event of their choice from our
[Instructor Training calendar](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar.html). Contact us at
[{{< param instructor_training_email >}}](mailto:{{< param instructor_training_email >}}) to learn more about our Instructor Training
program.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How should I select individuals to be trained as Instructors?" >}}
The choice of trainees is at the discretion of the Member. We recommend choosing trainees based on enthusiasm and
commitment to teaching. There are no specific technical skills required to become a Carpentries Instructor, and we welcome
individuals with a range of experiences and technical competencies. Trainees will be required to demonstrate their ability to
teach one of our lessons, with options ranging from spreadsheet formatting to Python programming. Although we do not provide
screening or selection of trainee candidates, Member organisations are welcome to make use of our
[application questions]({{< param amy_training >}}) and
[rubric](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/rubric.md), which we use for evaluating
non-member affiliated trainees. For more information about selecting trainees, read our [Information for Member Organisations](/support/membership) page.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How soon after signing my membership can I get started with Instructor Training?" >}}
In your 12 month membership period, we will be offering at least 6-8 online events scheduled across various timezones. To view a full list of upcoming training events please see our [Instructor Training Calendar](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar). Your trainees are invited to join any event(s) that suits their schedule(s), either as a group or individually, along with new trainees from other parts of our community.<br>

It is difficult to schedule events in every time zone, so your trainees are always welcome to join scheduled online events in adjacent time zones, given the times are reasonable for their schedule. However, knowing this may not be ideal for you, we will work with you to schedule an online event based on your needs and our Trainers’ availability. To ensure that we can meet everyone’s needs, we generally like to schedule these events 2-3 months in advance. Once this event is scheduled, we may invite people from other sites to join as well, to begin to build community in your part of the world.<br>
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do I find out if trainees at my site have completed Instructor Training or the certification process and how many seats remain available under my membership?" >}}
For best results, we recommend tracking this locally. Keeping in touch with trainees can have additional value in building your
local community. Due to regional variation in privacy laws and delays in our registration workflows, not all information from our
database is guaranteed to be available or fully up to date. You are welcome to email us at
[{{< param instructor_training_email >}}](mailto:{{< param instructor_training_email >}}) at any time with a request for information. We
will reply within 3-5 business days with the information we can provide.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What if I do not use all of my Instructor Training seats before the end of my membership?" >}}
The success of our program depends on accurately predicting our capacity needs, so we may not be able to accommodate all
situations.  However, we know unexpected things can come up. If you are nearing the end of your membership term and have not used
all your seats, please contact us at [{{< param membership_email >}}](mailto:{{< param membership_email >}}).
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What if I want to train more people at my site than my agreement allows?" >}}
All members are eligible to purchase additional Instructor Training seats at a discount.
Our current [pricing is here](/support/pricing/#instructor-training-pricing).
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Can individuals get trained to become Instructors outside of the context of institutional membership?" >}}
Yes! Individuals can purchase Instructor Training seats at the [a la carte price](/support/pricing/#instructor-training-pricing)
for their region. Individuals purchasing seats a la carte will receive equal priority with Members in scheduling.<br><br>
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What is the attendance policy for Instructor Training?" >}}
In the case of [no shows]({{< param handbook_url >}}/handbooks/instructors.html#no-shows), if extenuating circumstances have prevented a trainee from cancelling, contacting, or attending an event, they may request permission to register for an additional event using the same registration code by emailing [{{< param instructor_training_email >}}](mailto:{{< param instructor_training_email >}}). **IMPORTANT**: Requests to re-register must be received within **7 days after** the end date of the training. 

In the event of [partial absences]({{< param handbook_url >}}/handbooks/instructors.html#partial-absence) trainees who miss up to 4 hours (1 half day) of an event can schedule a 45-minute 1:1 makeup meeting to complete their training with The Carpentries Director of Workshops and Training. 

[Ineligibility for Makeup Opportunities]({{< param handbook_url >}}/handbooks/instructors.html#ineligibility-for-makeup-opportunities): Trainees who miss an event **in full without cancelling within 7 days (no-show)** or who miss part of an event but **do not request a makeup opportunity within 7 days** are ineligible to register for a new training event using the same registration code. Trainees interested in completing training may contact [{{< param instructor_training_email >}}](mailto:{{< param instructor_training_email >}}) to be advised on their options for re-admission.
{{< /accordion >}}

## Instructor Trainers in a Membership

{{< accordion title="What are Instructor Trainers?" >}}
Instructor Trainers teach The Carpentries Instructor Training Events. They train new Instructors in the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. They also support and play a leadership role in overseeing the Instructor Training program.

[Instructor Trainer Training](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/) is the process by which we onboard new Instructor Trainers. It consists of 10 weekly one-hour sessions, during which we discuss The Carpentries’ teaching philosophy and review supporting materials that summarise the research underpinning our [Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Are there any discounts available for Instructor Trainers?" >}}
Organisations supporting [Instructor Trainers]({{< param handbook_url >}}/handbooks/instructor_trainers.html#roles-and-responsibilities), who engage in service activities to teach and support newly trained Instructors across our global community, may be eligible for a discount on their membership fee equivalent to six (6) seats in Instructor Training per active Instructor Trainers. Members can choose whether they would like the Trainers discount applied as a monetary benefit or added to their account. This discount is available at any membership level, for each Instructor Trainer who has participated in the following, up to 1 year before renewal:
- Teach at least two (2) Instructor Training events for the global Carpentries community.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do I purchase an Instructor Trainer Training seat?" >}}
The Instructor Trainer Training seats can be added to your Membership package at any time—either during the initial agreement or afterwards. To request Instructor Trainer Training seats, please contact us at [{{< param membership_email >}}](mailto:{{< param membership_email >}}).
{{< /accordion >}}


## Collaborative Lesson Development Training

{{< accordion title="What is Collaborative Lesson Development Training?" >}}
[Collaborative Lesson Development Training](/lesson-development/) teaches essential skills and best practices for designing and developing lessons as open-source projects. The training will guide you through the design process and initial development of a new lesson, prepare you to work with the infrastructure we use to build accessible, open-source lesson websites, and provide some advice and techniques for effective collaboration on the project.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do I purchase Collaborative Lesson Development Training seats?" >}}

## Membership Management

{{< accordion title="Who are the Programmatic member contacts?" >}}
Programmatic member contacts are the primary liaisons for an organisation’s membership, ensuring seamless communication and effective management of membership benefits. They receive essential updates, coordinate membership activities, and facilitate engagement with The Carpentries community. We recommend having at least two Member Contacts per organisation to ensure continuity and shared responsibility.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do I update Member Contacts?" >}}
Email [{{< param membership_email >}}](mailto:{{< param membership_email >}}) to update your contacts.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What is the Membership Mailing List?" >}}
Programmatic member contacts are added to this mailing list for quarterly updates and announcements.
{{< /accordion >}}

## Member Engagement

{{< accordion title="What are Quarterly Membership Updates?" >}}
Every three months, Programmatic member contacts receive a detailed email outlining membership usage and trainee progress, helping them track engagement and maximise the benefits of their organisation’s membership.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What are Community Development Program Calls?" >}}
These [calls](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-development-program) take place every three months and offer valuable opportunities for networking, sharing updates, and fostering community growth.
