The Carpentries Sponsorship Program aims to help The Carpentries partner with like-minded organisations who want to contribute financially to help The Carpentries achieve our mission and vision.
With support from sponsors, The Carpentries will continue our efforts to make coding and data skills equitable globally and expand our operations to meet the needs of our community better now and in the future.
