## Introduction

At The Carpentries we are **_[Always Learning](/about-us/#our-values)_**. We embody the growth mindset we teach by using data and community feedback to measure our impact and foster continuous improvement.

## Annual Reports

Our annual reports serve as a high-level summary of The Carpentries' work, providing a succinct introduction to our organisation for potential funders, new members, and others joining our community. These reports also serve as a rich resource for our existing community members, showcasing the work and growth of our community and providing a summary of the previous year, and what we plan to achieve in the coming year. Our annual reports also include a short overview of our finances for the year. More information about our finances is available on our [Financials page](/about-us/financials).

## Assessment

We value a culture of assessment and consistently assess learner outcomes from workshops (short term), programmatic efforts (Instructor Training), and the long-term impact we have on learners.

### Measuring the Impact of Our Workshops and Training

We conduct pre- and post-event surveys for both Carpentries Workshops and Training Events. Use the links below to preview the questions currently included in our surveys:
