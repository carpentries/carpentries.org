The Carpentries, Inc. (The Carpentries) is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation governed by a Board of Directors. The Board consists of 7–13 members, drawn from The Carpentries community and external experts invited for their specific expertise. At least one-third of the Board members are elected by The Carpentries community.

## Roles and Responsibilities of the Board of Directors

The Board is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries public image. Members of the Board also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the organisation’s reputation and fundraising. The Board executes these responsibilities through meetings, regular correspondence, and collaboration via email and online platforms.
