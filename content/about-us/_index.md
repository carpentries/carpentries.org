## Introduction

The Carpentries is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit based in Delaware, USA. The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. We exist because the skills needed to do computational, data-intensive research are often not included as a part of basic research training in many disciplines. Our global community works together to provide:

- A suite of open source, collaboratively-built, community-developed lessons.
- Evidence-based, proven pedagogical training.
- Workshops based on a learn-by-doing, ‘code with me’ approach.
- A supportive learning culture.
- A global community which subscribes to an inclusive code of conduct.


## Our vision

Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills.

## Our mission

The Carpentries empowers a diverse global community by equipping individuals with essential data and computational skills.  We promote efficient, open, and reproducible research practices.  By fostering collaborative development of openly available lessons and research-informed teaching methods, we build an inclusive network of practictioners and advocates who emphasise the critical role of software and data in advancing research.

## Our values

Shared values and goals have long been the starting point of communities of practice as they identify changes they want to see and start working together towards these changes. The Carpentries community share nine core values.

## Our Work

The Carpentries administration and other essential operations are held together by a small [Core Team](/about-us/team/), but the majority of our impact is achieved through the efforts of volunteer participants in our global and local communities. The global [Carpentries community](/community/) consists of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, Lesson Developers, Member Organisations, committee or task force members, and other supporters who participate, synchronously or asynchronously, in building our programs for all to share.

## Our History

We have a rich history that dates back to 1998 when Software Carpentry was founded with the mission of teaching lab skills for research computing. At that time, Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda taught workshops to teach researchers software development skills. Greg continued this work, building a collection of collaboratively-developed and openly-available lessons, as well as community of instructors who used those lessons to teach workshops.

In 2014, Data Carpentry was founded with the mission of building communities teaching universal data literacy. Also in 2014, Library Carpentry was founded with the mission of teaching data skills to people working in library- and information-related roles. Each organisation working in tandem and in partnership to develop lessons and build global communities of practice.

In 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged their projects to form a new project called The Carpentries, under the fiscal sponsorship of Community Initiatives, and shortly thereafter welcomed Library Carpentry as a Lesson Program. In 2025, The Carpentries started operations as an independent 501(c)3 non-profit. 

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement

### Resources

[The Toolkit of IDEAS](https://zenodo.org/records/10391883) (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility Strategies) is a practical resource for Carpentries’ Instructors, helpers, and workshop hosts. We know that many people care about inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility but are not sure how it connects to teaching foundational coding and data science skills. This toolkit aims to bridge this gap.
