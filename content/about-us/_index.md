## Introduction

The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](https://communityinitiatives.org/), a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit based in California, USA. The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. We exist because the skills needed to do computational, data-intensive research are often not included as a part of basic research training in many disciplines. Our global community works together to provide:

- A suite of open source, collaboratively-built, community-developed lessons.
- Evidence-based, proven pedagogical training.
- Workshops based on a learn-by-doing, ‘code with me’ approach.
- A supportive learning culture.
- A global community which subscribes to an inclusive code of conduct.


## Our vision

Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills.

## Our mission

The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting and supporting research.

## Our values

Shared values and goals have long been the starting point of communities of practice as they identify changes they want to see and start working together towards these changes. The Carpentries community share nine core values.

## Our Work

The Carpentries administration and other essential operations are held together by a small [Core Team](/about-us/team/), but the majority of our impact is achieved through the efforts of volunteer participants in our global and local communities. The global [Carpentries community](/community/) consists of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, Lesson Developers, Member Organisations, committee or task force members, and other supporters who participate, synchronously or asynchronously, in building our programs for all to share.

## Our History

We have a rich history that dates back to 1998 when Software Carpentry was founded with the mission of teaching lab skills for research computing. At that time, Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda taught workshops to teach researchers software development skills. Greg continued this work, building a collection of collaboratively-developed and openly-available lessons, as well as community of instructors who used those lessons to teach workshops.

In 2014, Data Carpentry was founded with the mission of building communities teaching universal data literacy. Also in 2014, Library Carpentry was founded with the mission of teaching data skills to people working in library- and information-related roles. Each organisation working in tandem and in partnership to develop lessons and build global communities of practice.

In 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged their projects to form a new project called The Carpentries, under the fiscal sponsorship of Community Initiatives, and shortly thereafter welcomed Library Carpentry as a Lesson Program.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement

### Our Community is Our Strength

At The Carpentries, we are committed to building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community that values all individuals and their unique identities. We prioritise accessibility and inclusivity in our curricula and programs and value transparency, fairness, and honesty to build trust within our community. Building an inclusive community is an ongoing process that requires consistent effort and commitment, and we strive for continuous improvement.

### Accessibility Statement

The Carpentries is committed to providing inclusive and accessible content that enables all individuals, including those with disabilities, to participate and engage fully. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of Carpentries’ content and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines including those from the World Wide Web Consortium.

If there are any aspects of our community including the website, community discussions, instruction, or the design of our lessons that result in barriers to your inclusion, please [email us](mailto:{{< param team_email >}}) with as much information as possible including the name, location, and date of the event you attended, or any relevant links that provide context (e.g. Slack, GitHub).
