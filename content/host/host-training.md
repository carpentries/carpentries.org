## Overview
Carpentries Instructor Training gives you strategies to teach coding and data workshops. Our 16-hour hands-on training teaches the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. During the training, you will practise these new skills while getting to know others who share your interests.
After the training, you may complete three "checkout" steps to become a Certified Carpentries Instructor. Certified Instructors can volunteer to teach at our "centrally-organised workshops" with our global community virtually or in-person. They are also able to organise Carpentries workshops for their local community.

## Why Instructor Training?

* Trainees do not needed previous experience. Something here to speak to why * trainees with no previous experience will still excel.
* Evidence-Based Teaching Practices. Your Trainees will learn evidence-based * teaching practices to be more effective both in Carpentries workshops and * teaching more broadly.
* Create An Inclusive Classroom. Trainees leave with tools to create a positive * classroom environment.
* Become A Certified Carpentries Instructor. Being a Carpentries Instructor is a * great professional development opportunity for your Instructors. Carpentries * credentials can elevate their profile and yours on the global stage.
* Local Impact. Instructors have the option to team up with other colleagues to * self-organise Carpentries workshops that address the coding or data needs of * their peers. Instructors can lead the way to improve coding and data skills of * your organisation.
* Networking. When Instructors join an instructional team, they create connections * that can benefit your institution and combat isolation across departments and * professional communities around the world.
* Live Practice Instructor Training does not end with certification! Team teaching, along with Carpentries surveys and formative assessment practices, facilitate continued development of your Instructors’ teaching skills.
