 Lesson Developers help our community adapt to evolving training needs by creating new lessons. They develop and test lessons collaboratively, in The Carpentries Incubator and elsewhere. The certified Lesson Developers listed below have completed [Collaborative Lesson Development Training](/lesson-development/), learning good practices in lesson design, skills to work with The Carpentries lesson infrastructure, and techniques for effective collaboration.
