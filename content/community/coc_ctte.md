## The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee

The Carpentries is dedicated to developing and empowering a diverse community of enthusiasts around computational methods for research and data science. To facilitate this, The Carpentries has established a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) that governs behavior within the community. The Code of Conduct committee was established to enforce the Code and to manage any changes and updates to it.

Our Goal:  
To maintain, update, and enforce The Carpentries Code of Conduct (CoC).

Our Approach:  
We do this by conducting meetings where we review current CoC issues. If a CoC violation is reported to us, we process that by following the Enforcement Manual.

Our Structure:  
We have meetings as needed, and we have a private email list where Code of Conduct issues are discussed. We also have a private GitHub repo for internal discussion and organisation.

Our Leadership:  
The structure of the committee is such that a community member is the Chair of the Committee. In addition, a Core Team liaison is part of the committee, and a member of the Board of Directors serves as a Board liaison.

Contacting the Committee:  
Please email your concerns to [coc@carpentries.org](mailto:{{< param coc_email >}}). All correspondence will be treated in confidence.

Our Governance Structure: Please see the [Code of Conduct Committee (CoCc) Governance document](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/coc-governance.html) to find details on membership, onboarding, administration, positions, roles, and responsibilities.

[Jean Baptiste Fankam Fankam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-baptiste-fankam-fankam-19b728a2/) is a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of the Witwatersrand. After completing a PhD in Physics with a focus on Computational Materials Science in December 2021 at the University of Yaounde I, Cameroon, he sought to deepen his knowledge of CLI, Unix shell, and Python programming. Recognizing the importance of High-Performance Computing (HPC) for international recognition in his field, he searched for workshops and discovered a transformative online Carpentries Workshop on Unix shell. This led him to pursue further training, becoming a certified Carpentries instructor in April 2023 and later a Carpentries Maintainer. His active participation in the Carpentries community motivated him to apply for a leadership role on the Code of Conduct Committee. Since certification, he has taught numerous workshops locally and internationally, demonstrating his commitment by ensuring stable internet connections for his sessions, even while completing a postdoctoral position at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. He will be available for a data science or AI-based position after August 2024.
