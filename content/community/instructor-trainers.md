hideToc: true

The Instructor Trainer community is a group of experienced Instructors, local champions, and education specialists who inspire and train new Instructors. They work as a team to maintain and teach the [Instructor Training curriculum]({{< param instructor_training_curriculum >}}). They also host teaching demonstration sessions to provide vital feedback as prospective Carpentries Instructors prepare to join the community. Instructor Trainers scale their impact - sharing their passion, experience, and enthusiasm with the next generation of The Carpentries Instructors.

Instructor Trainers may temporarily or permanently step away from this role. To continue to acknowledge their contributions to The Carpentries, we list them as [Trainer Alumni](/community/instructor-trainer-alumni/).
