## Overview

Instructor Trainers (Trainers) teach The Carpentries Instructor Training Events. They train new Instructors in the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. They also support and play a leadership role in the oversight of the Instructor Training program.

Instructor Trainer Training is the process by which we onboard new Instructor Trainers. The training consists of 10 weekly 1-hour sessions, where we will discuss The Carpentries teaching philosophy and review supporting materials summarising the research that underpins our Instructor Training curriculum.
