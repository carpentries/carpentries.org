The Carpentries hosts a large collection of lessons teaching a range of software and data skills for a variety of audiences. This collection combines lessons from our lesson programs, which each focus on a slightly different target audience and mission.

All lessons are self-contained, but many form part of a larger curriculum and are designed to have the most impact within that context. If a lesson particularly interests you as a teaching or learning resource, we recommend that you explore the rest of the curriculum and/or lesson program that it is drawn from. To help you decide which Lesson Program is best for you, please read the [overview of our curricula](/lessons/curriculum-summary/). 

All of our lessons have been collaboratively developed by members of The Carpentries community, and subsequently updated and polished based on extensive testing and feedback from Instructors.

Our lessons are built using the [Workbench](/workbench), a custom open-source software framework written in R.
