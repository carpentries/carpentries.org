## About our lessons 

The Carpentries hosts a large collection of lessons teaching a range of software and data skills for a variety of audiences. This collection combines lessons from our lesson programs, which each focus on a slightly different target audience and mission.

All lessons are self-contained, but many form part of a larger curriculum and are designed to have the most impact within that context. If a lesson particularly interests you as a teaching or learning resource, we recommend that you explore the rest of the curriculum and/or lesson program that it is drawn from.

All of our lessons have been collaboratively developed by members of The Carpentries community, and subsequently updated and polished based on extensive testing and feedback from Instructors.
