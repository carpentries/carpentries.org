The table below lists all lessons labelled “help wanted” and/or “good first issue” on all of our official lesson repositories and many lesson repositories in [The Carpentries Incubator]({{< param incubator_link >}}). We hope it will help you find opportunities to contribute to Carpentries lessons and projects.

If you maintain a lesson in The Carpentries Incubator or The Carpentries Lab and would like to include issues from your lesson repository in this table, please read the [Information for Lesson Maintainers](#information-for-maintainers) at the end of the page.

## Information for Maintainers
Community-owned repositories are included in this page at the maintainers’ discretion: if you are a developer/maintainer of a lesson from The Carpentries Incubator or The Carpentries Lab and would like to add your repository to this listing, add the `helpwanted-list` topic to your repository ([learn more about managing repository topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#adding-topics-to-your-repository)). Remove the topic again to remove issues from your repository from this page. You may need to wait several hours for the changes to take effect here.

[Read this guide to learn more about how and when to add "help wanted" and other labels to issues on your lesson repository]({{< param handbook_url >}}/handbooks/maintainers.html#using-issue-labels-to-promote-collaboration).
