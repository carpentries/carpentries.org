[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) (formerly Quantum GIS) is an open source [Geographic Information System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system).

QGIS is capable of advanced analysis and cartography, but I don't use it for that. 

In my research in hydrodynamic modelling, I deal with a lot of spatial data - coastlines, bathymetry, and the like - 
and this will eventually be processed and plotted using R, MATLAB or Python.

But if I've received a file and simply want to take a quick look at it, or if I want to 
quickly compare two files that use different coordinate systems and see if things line up, most of the time I can
throw the file at QGIS and it will show it to me with a few clicks. This approach lacks the 
reproducibility of a coded solution, but it's an awful lot quicker for a throwaway visualisation.
