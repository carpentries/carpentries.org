[CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) will be the key community building event in The Carpentries' annual calendar. To 
be held in Dublin from 30 May - 1 June, 2018, CarpentryCon will be three action-packed days of skill ups, 
breakout sessions, talks, social events (there will be a conference dinner), and workshops.

Who do we want to see there?

YOU!

Grad student? *Tick.* 

Post-doc? *Tick.* 

Working in industry? *Tick.* 

Project or lab leader? *Tick.*

Research Software Engineer? *Tick.* 

Librarian supporting researchers? *Tick.*

The list could go on, but what it boils down to is there'll be something for everyone.

Maybe you are very new to The Carpentries community. Maybe you have attended a workshop, helped at a workshop, 
or just heard that The Carpentries do amazing things to help researchers.

Come to CarpentryCon and find out more about what we do, how you can get involved, and how being part of 
this great community can change your skill levels, your career trajectory, and maybe even your life. Lots of 
people have changed careers after attending our workshops, after finding that the coding and data skills they 
thought were unattainable were actually well within their grasp. So do not let being new to our community be a barrier - 
we have all kinds of plans to help even the newest members of our community feel that they belong with us.

Maybe you are based somewhere that *has* no Carpentries community. If so, then joining our community - our 
global community - is one way to end that isolation. Find people working in the same discipline, or with 
the same tools, and make connections to help you feel less alone once you go back home again. Who knows? 
Maybe you will be inspired to kick start your *own* community. If so, we have lots of ways we can help.

Perhaps you're already a Carpentries Instructor, Trainer, or Lesson Maintainer? (Did you hear that rhyme?) CarpentryCon 
will provide lots of opportunities for those groups both to network and cross-network.

Older hands - people who have been in the community for a while - we want *you* at CarpentryCon to show new 
people the ropes and help them develop the skills to drive their careers forward. From sessions on leading 
projects or research labs to breakouts on mentoring and diversity, our community has so much to offer 
new people just starting out. 

We plan to offer professional development sessions that will augment your Master's 
or PhD qualifications so that your career can really go places. (Have a look at what skills volunteering 
as an [Instructor](https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-instructors.md), 
[Trainer](https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-trainers.md), 
or [Lesson Maintainer](https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-maintainers.md) 
in The Carpentries can add to your CV.)

And did I mention that the contacts you will make at CarpentryCon will be invaluable?   

We also have some fantastic [keynote speakers](http://www.carpentrycon.org/#comp). Valerie Aurora, a diversity and inclusion 
consultant who co-founded the [Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org/), will not only speak, but will run her 
fantastic [Ally Skills Workshop](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop/) on the final day. Anelda 
van der Walt - and who better? - will talk about community building throughout Africa. Desmond Higgins, 
who developed Clustal, will keynote about that groundbreaking work. And Software Carpentry co-founder 
Greg Wilson will speak about how we all got here in the first place.

We will have plenty of [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) content - not least an onboarding workshop for existing 
Instructors who want to teach the material. We will have *Next Steps in R* and a session on using 
Carpentry methods in university courses. We have also slotted in some Open Mic 'unconference'-style sessions 
so good ideas on the day can have a chance to be voted on to the program.

And it's Dublin in May! Where else would you rather be? Check out the [program](http://www.carpentrycon.org/#prog),
