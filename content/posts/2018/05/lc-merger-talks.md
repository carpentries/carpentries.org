On 1 January, 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry officially merged to form a new project called [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

The original projects remain as distinct lesson entities, but governance, staffing, assessment, and a range of other matters 
now come under the merged identity - The Carpentries - which is typified by the 
new [website](https://carpentries.org/) and [handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/).

Many in our community might have heard of [Library Carpentry](http://librarycarpentry.org), a project that began when 
Dr. James Baker and others adapted Software Carpentry workshop materials to teach librarians software and data 
skills at a London workshop in 2015. 

News of the workshop quickly spread around the world and a community sprang up around the further development and 
teaching of these materials. 

A two-day [sprint in 2016](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/06/library-carpentry-sprint.html) really kickstarted the community. 
Three sprints later, ([see 2018 report](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/05/lc-sprint-report/)), there are a 
large number of lessons, a burgeoning community, an interim governance group, and now a dedicated 
staffer in [Chris Erdmann](https://twitter.com/libcce), the new Library Carpentry Community and Development Director, 
who is working on community building and lesson development as part of a two-year, IMLS-funded grant.

In order to grow, however, Library Carpentry needs the support structures that have helped The Carpentries 
become such a global force - instructor training, workshop co-ordination, and systematic assessment. 

Accordingly, rather than 'go it alone', a decision was taken by 
the [Library Carpentry governance group](http://librarycarpentry.org/#team) to open discussions with 
The Carpentries about becoming a Lesson Organisation. The motion to do so was carried unanimously 
at the group's last meeting on 16 May. On The Carpentries' side, a motion to pursue discussion was also passed by the [Executive Council](https://carpentries.org/governance/), 
which means both sides are in agreement that this process should commence!

With this agreement, we'll begin aligning operations, so look for updates over the next few months.

Library Carpentry has its own [blog](http://librarycarpentry.org/blog/) and [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/libcarpentry). 

We're looking forward to our next steps together!
