May 2018 is almost over
and The Carpentries Executive Council
wants to provide a brief report of their activities
during the first four months of 2018.
We are slowly getting to know each other,
our role as the Executive Council
and what it means that we now are a single organisation.

Executive Council members are listed on the [Governance page](https://carpentries.org/governance/)
where you can also find links to the minutes of the Executive Council monthly meetings.

## Finances

The first thing the Executive Council reviewed were the finances,
and The Carpentries are fiscally healthy through 2018 based on the projections.

## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Operations

At the time of the merge,
most of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
activities were already shared,
but we still have a few minor details
in operations that are different.
The Executive Council is advising
staff in the best way to align operations
of both organisations
and facilitate the onboarding process
of future lesson organisations.

## Mission & Vision

A major task will be to determine the Mission and Vision statements of the new organisation.
We are preparing a process where the community will be asked for ideas and information.
This input is key to developing the mission and vision of the organisation,
and the Executive Council will use this information in developing draft text
and plans for collecting and incorporating feedback.

## Bylaws

As a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/),
The Carpentries isn't required to have Bylaws (a set of operating rules for the new organisation)
but the Executive Council believes that having this kind of document is important,
so much of the time in the previous four months has been devoted to drafting the Bylaws for the new organisation.
The new Bylaws are inspired by the ones from Software Carpentry
and those of other similar non-profit organisations.
The Executive Council hopes to open a Request for Comments (RFC)
around July after the Executive Council in-person meeting in the middle of June.

## Talk with us

You can contact the Executive Council by [email](mailto:executive-council@carpentries.org).
