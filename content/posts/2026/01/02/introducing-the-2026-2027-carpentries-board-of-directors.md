## Introducing the 2026–2027 Carpentries Board of Directors

We are excited to share an update that reflects both progress and possibility. The past year marked a major inflection point for The Carpentries as we completed our transition to an independent non-profit and began operating with a new governance model. In the future, our Board of Directors will continue to work alongside the Core Team, community, and our partners to advance our mission and deliver on the strategic priorities outlined in our bridge [2026-2028 Strategic Plan](https://carpentries.org/about-us/strategic-plan/).

This moment is about continuity and renewal: honouring the leadership that brought us here, welcoming new voices, and aligning our governance work with our goals for impact, sustainability, and community scale.

## Reflecting on 2025 Board Service

As we closed out 2025, the Board released its **Activities Report**, providing transparency into its work during a foundational year for the organisation. The report documents key areas of focus, including fiduciary responsibility, organisational independence, policy development, and board formation.

You can [explore the full report in our public governance repository](https://github.com/carpentries/governance).

## Board Leadership Transitions

We are deeply grateful to our Board officers and standing committee chairs, whose terms concluded on 1 February 2025.

Our outgoing officers and standing committee chairs are:

- Yanina Bellini Saibene - President (Chair)
- Phil Brooks - Vice President (Chair-Elect) 
- Luke Corbin - Chair of the Governance and Personnel Committee
- Nisha Ghatak - Chair of the Program Committee.

The following officers and standing committee chairs will continue to serve in their role:

- Yo Yehudi - Secretary
- François Michonneau - Treasurer 
- Paola Corrales - Chair of the Finance Committee
- Mark Crowe - Chair of the Audit Committee
- Jannetta Steyn - Liaison to the Code of Conduct Committee

And, we are proud to introduce those onboarding into their new leadership roles on the Board of Directors:

- Phil Brooks - President (Chair)
- Nisha Ghatak - Vice President (Chair-Elect) 
- Yanina Bellini Saibene - Chair of the Governance and Personnel Committee
- Samantha Ahern - Chair of the Program Committee

## Board Priorities for 2026

The Board’s 2026 work plan is very closely aligned with our strategic goals for the coming years. At a high level, the Board will focus on:

- Strengthening financial sustainability and diversification to support long-term impact.  
- Supporting curriculum growth in emerging and interdisciplinary domains.  
- Advancing governance maturity, policies, and board development.  
- Enabling scalable community leadership models across regions and sub-communities.  
- Providing strategic guidance and accountability as we execute the 2026–2028 plan.  

This is a year of building with intention. With a strong Board, a clear strategy, and an engaged global community, we are well positioned to move from transition to transformation.

Thank you for being part of this journey. We are energised by what lies ahead and grateful for the collective work that makes our mission possible.

With appreciation and optimism,  
*Kari & Phil*
