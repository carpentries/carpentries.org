The Carpentries is delighted to welcome five newly-certified Lesson Developer Trainers! 

* Thomas Cason  
* Sally Chang  
* Johan Hidding  
* Nathaniel Porter  
* Jannetta Steyn

This new cohort of Trainers enriches the existing group teaching [Collaborative Lesson Development Training](/lesson-development/) (CLDT), bringing a wealth and diversity of experience to share with our lesson developers. These five community members completed a seven-week program of Trainer Training to gain certification, combining relevant reading tasks and reflective discussions with support from members of the Curriculum Team and Maintainers of the [CLDT curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/). 

We are grateful to all of our Lesson Development Trainers who contribute their time and expertise to support The Carpentries community, and we are excited to begin teaching alongside these new members of the Trainer community!


In addition to delivering Collaborative Lesson Development Training events, Trainers will host frequent *Pilot Workshop Debrief* sessions: opportunities for community members to connect and discuss the process and experience of trialling a new lesson or curriculum. [Visit the Community Calendar](/community/events/) to find out when the next session will be taking place in your time zone.
