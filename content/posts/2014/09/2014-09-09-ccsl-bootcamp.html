<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>Last week Alex Viana and I taught two Software Carpentry workshops
at the Universidade S&atilde;o Paulo, the biggest public university in Brazil.
In both workshops we took them through Bash, Git and Python over the course of
two days.</p>

<h3>First Workshop</h3>

<p>We had 18 people subscribe and 27 names on the waitlist. Because of that we were
waiting for a full room but only 10 students showed up (we still trying to figure
out why this happened) with different previous programming experience but all
from bioinformatics fields.</p>

<p>The first day started with Alex teaching the Unix shell. Most of the students
used it before but from the feedback they liked discovering some new commands
and that you can write your own shell scripts.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I taught Python.
This wasn't the best session because I got the wrong impression from the
students: the ones asking the most questions during the session were already
programming in Perl and were asking questions to figure out the
differences between Python and Perl. Moreover, looks like
<a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/issues/689">our lesson has a small time issue</a>.</p>

<p>The second day started with Alex teaching Git. This was the best presentation
of Git I've ever seen: Alex was very calm presenting exactly the lessons
available at our website (except for the fact that for the collaborating and
conflict lesson students worked in pairs
like <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc/pull/694">Thomas Kluyver's proposal</a>
that I plan to review soon)
and students followed it up without problems. At the end
of the Git session students wanted answers for advanced questions and we extended
the session for more one hour.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we changed our original plans
and split the class into two groups. The first group, with more advanced
programming skills, had a demo session of Pandas with Alex,
while the second group
had an exercise session on the concepts learned at the previous day (functions,
loops, etc.).</p>

<h3>Second Workshop</h3>

<p>18 people subscribed, with 23 names on the waitlist. Unlike the first workshop
we had around 18 students (full room), most from bioinformatics without previous
programming experience.</p>

<p>The first day started with Alex teaching the Unix shell. Some students liked
this first section but most of them still asked themselves, "Why am I
learning this?". In the afternoon I taught Python and for the first time I got
feedback saying that I was too slow. I had purposely reduced the speed of the
lesson but also had to interrupt it a few times before the break because
many students were having troubles with Anaconda and IPython Notebook.</p>

<p>The second day started with Alex teaching Git. Again some students had
troubles with the installation (all the cases of students using Mac OS X) but
after some time we solved the problems. As in the first round, Alex's lesson was
great but this time students didn't asked advanced questions at the end. In the
afternoon, I finished the Python lesson (I didn't taught the loop lesson in the
first day) and gave a quick example of matplotlib and Pandas.</p>
