  Our ACM student chapter at King Abdullah University of Science and
  Technology (KAUST) is active in supporting the diverse research
  community at our university. We decided to offer Python tutorials to
  our community by the end of 2013. Due to no information on the
  background and interests of KAUST community, we crafted a short
  survey to help us in tailoring our tutorials. The following image
  shows the summary of the responses we got:

</p>
<p>
  We focused on two areas in the survey; Programming level and
  applications interest. We prepared a week-long workshop during
  February 23-27, offering seven sessions on Python tutorials. The
  workshop was greatly accepted by university community; we had full
  registration in few hours and we had 40-50 registration in each
  session.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth mentioning that the timing of the tutorials was
  carefully selected to maximize the graduate students registration.
  Classes start early February, where the students usually attend
  extra classes in the first two weeks to decide which courses to keep
  or drop. If we offered our tutorials after February, we would had
  less attendance because classes mid-terms and projects pressure
  starts till the end of the semester. These facts motivated us to
  select the last week of February to offer our tutorials, where the
  students are least busy and available on campus.
</p>
<p>
  We believe that making the tutorial hands-on was an important
  choice. The attendants were specialized in different fields:
  Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, etc. They had different
  programming background. This made it difficult to find a suitable
  pace in these tutorials.
</p>
<p>
  The responses we received in our feedback survey after the tutorials
  were generally satisfactory.
