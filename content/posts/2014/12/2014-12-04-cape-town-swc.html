  Last week we ran the biggest software carpentry workshop in South
  Africa to date. We had more than 80 participants in two rooms, each
  using the novice Python material. Pre-workshop assessment surveys
  showed that we'd have a mostly novice crew, but with a few outliers
  on the upper end. We accepted slightly higher than 80 enrollment cap
  and encouraged those with more advanced skills to evaluate their
  interest in becoming SWC workshop instructors themselves and help us
  out as helpers.

  Finding participants, local instructors, and helpers was not
  hard. Everyone enthusiastically jumped at the opportunity to be
  involved in a novel way of training newbies and more experienced
  people in the art of computing for research. Not only was the
  international community thrilled to participate and help organise
  the event, but local institutes, Deans, Professors, Research leaders
  as well as Research administrators and funders pulled together to
  sponsor the event and attendance of students. Partial funding was
  obtained through a Knowledge, Interchange, and Collaboration grant
  from the South African National Research Foundation. When we were
  running low on sponsorships, the University of Cape Town (UCT) ICTS
  department and UCT Research Office came to the rescue. The
  Bioinformatics Services Platform funded by the Department of Science
  and Technology also generously contributed funding to sponsor
  international instructors' travel. Furthermore the organizers of the
  preceding eResearch Africa Conference, the Association of South
  African University Directors of Information Technology (ASAUDIT),
  assisted with registration of participants.

  Our participants were a good mix of postgraduate students,
  post-doctoral research fellows, lecturers, researchers and
  professors, as well as IT specialists and librarians from 11 South
  African research institutes across four of our country's provinces
  joined us at the University of Cape Town. Three students travelled
  > 1,000km to attend the workshop.
</p>
<p>
    We had an excellent venue in the Snape Engineering Building of UCT's upper
    campus with an area across the courtyard for food and tea throughout the
    workshop. Wifi, power and high resolution projectors kept us all happy and on
    the same page. Superb technical support staff were on hand at all times to make
    sure things ran as smoothly as possible for learners. Attendees were able to
    mingle during the two hours of tea and lunch breaks each day, forging strong
    research partnerships and collaborations. There was a constant buzz when the 80
    learners were socializing and refueling between instructional sessions, with
    informal times being just as important in developing communities of practice in
    various disciplines.
</p>
<p>
  We had a relatively even mix of Windows, Linux and Mac computers
  with linux users sailing through with limited problems. Mac and
  Windows users had various problems with the most interesting being a
  locale issue for Macs set to South African English trying to run
  ipython notebook (addressed by setting
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15591007">these shell
  variables</a>). Other than that there were various issues with old
  versions of Mac OS not running Git without XCode and various other
  minor issues that were mostly resolvable.

  Our instructors traveled from the United Kingdom, the United States,
  Johannesburg, Italy and Cape Town. We had Jonah Duckles and David
  Merand in the first room and James Hetherington, Bruce Becker and
  Peter van Heusden in the second room. Prior to the workshop we had
  worked out who would be teaching various modules and built a jovial
  and collaborative teaching rapport during the conference leading up
  to the workshop. Material covered was the standard novice material
  covering shell, Git and Python, but not SQL. We taught shell and Git
  the first day, using
  a <a href="http://github.com/jduckles/uct-data">data Git
  repository</a> we had learners clone the data sets to their
  computer, working out Git and network connection bugs as a
  first-step. We talked about how we'd be learning more about Git, but
  for now to see this <code>git clone
  http://github.com/jduckles/uct-data</code> command as a way to get
  the files in the repo to our local machine so we could use them. By
  the end of the first day we had covered shell, git local, git remote
  and set the stage for learning about Python the following day.
</p>
<p>
  The second day covered all of the Python modules, going at a pretty
  slow pace as many learners were new to programming in general. We
  solicited feedback at each half-day and overall we struck a good
  balance of challenging learners with new concepts, while not leaving
  them frustrated and giving up.

<p>
  By the end of the second day we had a lot of interest in follow-on
  concepts and learners were excited to see that all of the material
  they had worked was available online. We had excellent conversations
  and connections being built around the entirety of the South African
  research community and the enthusiasm and energy of the participants
  was evdident, even though their brains were a bit fried by the end.
</p>
<p>
  We had an excellent set of 13 helpers coming from various institutions: Dane
  Kennedy (CSIR), Heine de Jager (UCT), Ashley Rustin (UCT), Armin Deffur (UCT),
  Anelda van der Walt (UCT),  Chris Mitshengu (UCT), Gustavo Salazar (UCT), Jon
  Ambler (UCT), Benjamin Hugo (UCT), Jon Zwart (UCT), Adrianna Pinska (UCT),
  Timothy Povall (UCT) and  Eugene de Beste (UWC). They were very enthusiastic
  and were also learning new things while helping to get learners moving through
  various technical challenges and hands-on exercises.
