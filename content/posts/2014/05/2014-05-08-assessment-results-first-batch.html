  As many of our instructors and participants know Software Carpentry
  has been giving surveys for a number of months at every possible
  workshop.  This takes a surprising amount of coordination and
  attention, much of which we owe to our wonderful two administrators:
  Amy Brown and Arliss Collins.  The surveys are being administered
  before and after each workshop in an effort to gather difference
  data which could answer questions such as "How useful was this
  workshop to participants?", "Who benefits most from these
  workshops?", or "What ways could we improve the workshop?"  We can
  also use this information to ask about the professional demographics
  such as "What fields are most represented by our participants?"  and
  "What's the typical amount of programming experience?"  both of
  which could help inform a tailored workshop experience to better
  suit the audience.

  I'll share with you the first of some data out of this assessment
  effort.  At least half of the survey is designed to enable
  participants to self-report how familiar or skilled they think
  they are given hypothetical tasks for a variety of situations.
  The surveys measure familiarity and skill for the Shell, Version
  Control Systems (VCS), Testing, and SQL, which were identified as
  some of the Software Carpentry core competencies.  Right now I'll
  go over Shell and leave the other three core analyses for a later
  time.  The first question I ask is "How does familiarity and skill
  for the Shell change over the course of the workshop?"

<p>
  There are four levels of responses for familiarity of the Shell
  which I'll summarize: "Not familiar," "Familiar in name only,"
  "Familiar but never used," and "Familiar because I use it."  The
  actual choices are more detailed than I describe here.  The figure
  titled "Workshop influence on Shell familiarity" summarizes 43
  data points of difference between before and after, showing a
  positive distribution of relative changes in familiarity levels
  with the Shell.  This is great to see because it means over half
  the participants improved by 2 or more familiarity levels over the
  course of the workshop, implying they identified as "now familiar"
  or "familiar because they're using it now".  The number of data
  points is small because this analysis ignores participants who
  either started out at the maximum familiarity level, or weren't
  obviously taught the Shell.  It's too bad there seems to be one
  participant who either marked the survey wrong or felt they had
  originally rated their familiarity too high, and thus showed up as
  a negatively directed change.
</p>
<p>
  In the figure "Workshop influence on Shell skill" I ask a more
  specific question: "How has skill level changed for participants
  who began the workshop able to use the Shell?"  The problem posed
  was inquiring about how they might go about solving a file
  filtering by contents problem and the choices were roughly "I
  can't do it," "Use Find, Copy, &amp; Paste," "Basic Shell
  commands," "I'd use a pipeline of commands."  The results are
  encouraging that more than half the participants who could use the
  shell to begin with left the workshop feeling they had a better
  grasp of applying their knowledge of the Shell to realistic
  problems.

  Next I asked "How much did participants improve from each
  beginning condition for the Shell?"  This next figure shows three
  starting conditions: no familiarity with the shell, name only
  familiarity, and familiar but never used.  Each subfigure shows
  how participants who began with that condition of familiarity
  progressed over the workshop.  It's encouraging that for each
  beginning condition nearly everyone improved their familiarity,
  and the majority of participants improved to the point of being a
  user.

</p>
<p>
  To get an overall impression of participant improvement I asked
  "What is the direction of relative change in familiarity for each
  core competency?"  On average, familiarity with each core
  competency increases sometimes greatly.  The totals vary for each
  item because maximum scoring pre-assessment participants are being
  ignored because their change in level should be zero and they will
  bias the average.  Raw data points have been jittered for viewing
  purposes.

  Let's finish off with a figure from assessment interviews.  I've
  so far interviewed 23 participants 3 or more months after their
  respective Software Carpentry experiences.  The following figure
  quantifies how often previous participants mentioned various
  Software Carpentry topics being useful, good to know, or important
  to them.  The most notable (python, command line, and git) are
  tools participants mentioned now using as a direct result of the
  workshop.  Some of the other subjects were not as expected, such
  as psychology, knowing, and resources.  Psychology refers to the
  useful tidbits like Greg often mentions, such as the optimal size
  of a function, recommended frequency of taking breaks, and other
  productivity tips.  Knowing is when a participant is glad to know
  about something such as SQL, but they don't use it, or have any
  plans to use it in the near future.  Resources is when instructors
  mention useful resources such as an online regular expressions
  tester, or a good book about python programming.  Alternative is
  when a participant explicitly mentioned it was useful to be shown
  alternative methods to accomplish tasks they could already
  perform.  Lastly, reading refers to participants who expressed an
  interest in improving their ability to read other people's code.

  I still have a bit more data to work through, but hopefully this
  gives you a good idea of what's going on with Software Carpentry
  effectiveness.  I'll leave you with some fun professional
  demographics of Software Carpentry participants.  (Note, there are
  more fields or career stages than you might expect because people
  would sometimes put something in 'other' and I haven't done any hand
  aggregating yet)
