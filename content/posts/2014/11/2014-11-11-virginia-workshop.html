  We pulled off our day-long data analysis bootcamp with hardly a
  hiccup yesterday. The schedule looked something like this:
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr><td>AM pt 1:</td><td>intro to AWS &amp; intro to Unix Shell</td></tr>
  <tr><td>AM pt 2:</td><td>data analysis in Unix: alignment, quantitation of RNA-seq data</td></tr>
  <tr><td>PM pt 1:</td><td>intro to R</td></tr>
  <tr><td>PM pt 2:</td><td>data analysis in R: QC, differential expression, etc.</td></tr>
</table>

  I got a grant from Amazon to give all the students in the class a
  $100 voucher to use AWS. We only used about $1 during the
  course. Luckily everyone registered and tested their AWS credentials
  prior to class, and we had everyone successfully connected to their
  own AWS instance using an image that I created specifically for this
  course. I had nightmares that half the class would show up
  unprepared and we'd lose everyone in the first half hour. This was a
  huge relief that this worked so well.
</p>
<p>
  AM part 1: Jessica did an excellent job with the intro to Unix shell
  session. This used material that we adapted from some SWC and some
  Data Carpentry material, but adapted to the data we were actually
  using in AM part 2. Adapted material was attributed as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  AM part 2: this was a little bit rushed, but I know some things to
  fix next time.
</p>
<p>
  PM part 1: I used material I created before SWC started working on R
  material. I've used this material in the past, and I think it works
  reasonably well, at least judging from the feedback we've gotten
  before. But personally I'm becoming less and less happy with it for
  various reasons, and I may consider adapting some of the SWC or data
  carpentry R material once these communities decide where they're
  going with them.
</p>
<p>
  PM part 2: this was also mostly material I had used in the past
  which has worked well. I started this material about a year ago, and
  during last spring's Mozilla sprint, Rob Beagrie worked with me to
  whip some of this into shape for an SWC capstone project in
  bioinformatics. (I think the PR is still outstanding.) I intend on
  submitting a PR to data carpentry with this material, and perhaps
  back to SWC once the repos are split and we start talking about
  domain-specific capstone examples once more.

  There was one particular part of this lesson which generated some
  confusion: where the column header metadata from one dataset had to
  match the row header metadata from another dataset, so that the data
  and metadata could be linked into a single object. When I run this
  lesson again I'd like to look at other ways of doing this kind of
  analysis to avoid having to go into this. It's an important concept,
  but I couldn't do it justice in the amount of time I had.
</p>
<p>
  A few lessons learned/reinforced:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    We had a class of &gt;20 (also, a pretty good gender balance). It
    would have been literally impossible to do this effectively
    without two instructors. The pacing in the morning intro to UNIX
    was as good as could be expected, but several folks would have
    gotten left behind right from the beginning without someone
    walking around helping folks individually. Likewise with the
    afternoon - Jessica saved me a few times where someone would have
    gotten completely lost from the beginning, yet I didn't have time
    to help them out individually myself. In the future with a course
    like this we really need two instructors <em>and</em> a TA that's
    familiar with everything we're doing, to do this effectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cough drops: I started helping people set up at 7:30am, and didn't
    finish until 5:30pm. Again, Jessica saved the day with Ricola
    lozenges at about 2pm.
  </li>
  <li>
    I think things went well, but I might like to limit our scope for
    something like this again. We had folks in the room who were
    experts with R, others who were showing me things at the UNIX
    shell that even I didn't know, and yet others who had never typed
    anything into a terminal before. It's difficult to have this broad
    of a distribution in the same classroom.
  </li>
  <li>
    As much as I would have liked to have everyone set up software on
    their own machine, this was impossible to do for AM part 2. We
    needed to run software that only runs on Linux machines, and we
    needed &gt;8GB RAM to do it. Most folks don't have this available
    on their laptop. Thankfully we got AWS working for everyone, but
    it took lots of e-mail reminders and careful handholding prior to
    the course to make sure this worked successfully. I'm relatively
    new to AWS myself, and would benefit from attending some kind of
    AWS training, or even better, shadowing a more experienced
    instructor who regularly uses AWS for things like this.
