<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>

  The discussion around last month's post
  "<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/why-we-dont-teach-testing.html">Why We Don't Teach Testing (Even Though We'd Like To)</a>"
  has been one of the most interesting in Software Carpentry's history.
  Inspired by that,
  and by discussion at <a href="http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/WSSSPE2/">WSSSPE 2.0</a>,
  we are launching a collaborative book project called
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/close-enough-for-scientific-work">Close Enough for Scientific Work</a>
  in which scientists will show one another how they test their software.
</p>
<p>
  Contributions should be aimed at sophomores in science and engineering,
  and each should be sized to fit a one-hour lecture.
  While the format of each entry will vary according to its content,
  we expect most will follow this template:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ol>
  <li>
    Introduce the problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    Present a simple solution (100-200 lines of code).
  </li>
  <li>
    Show how to test that code, explaining:
    <ul>
      <li>
	what tests have been chosen,
      </li>
      <li>
	why they have been chosen, and
      </li>
      <li>
	how the author decided on the tolerances for those tests.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) Add a feature, or extend the program in some other way, and show:
    <ul>
      <li>
	how the tests are extended to handle the change, and
      </li>
      <li>
	how the testing pays off.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</p>

  You may use any (widely-used) format and programming language you like&mdash;we
  will employ a professional editor to handle copy editing and production.
  However, we ask that you <em>don't</em>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    explain unit testing, the difference between verification and validation, etc. (we'll do that),
  </li>
  <li>
    explain how floating point works or that it's hard (ditto), or
  </li>
  <li>
    use math that even your close colleagues would have to look up.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We have used this model to produce several previous books,
  including:

  If you would like to contribute, please either
  submit a pull request to
  <a href="{{site.github_url}}/close-enough-for-scientific-work">the repository</a>
  <a href="mailto:gvwilson@software-carpentry.org">mail Greg Wilson</a>.
  And please help spread the word&mdash;we
  think that a couple of dozen worked examples
  will help most scientists more than any amount of preaching,
  and between us,
  we ought to be able to put them together.
