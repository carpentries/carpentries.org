  Keeping on the roll of the posts about the
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/09/splitting-the-repo.html">repo
  split</a>,
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/new-lesson-template-v2.html">templates</a>,
  and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/10/of-templates-and-metadata.html">metadata</a>,
  Software Carpentry now needs to consider how to handle translated
  lessons. The core Software Carpentry lessons have be translated by
  bilingual instructors into
  <a href="https://github.com/statkclee/xwmooc-sc/tree/gh-pages">Korean</a>
  produced by Victor KC Lee (and friends)
  and <a href="https://github.com/franktoffel/swcarpentry-es/tree/master/translations/es">Spanish</a>
  by Francisco Navarro (and friends).
  With the upcoming repo split, I
  think its a good time to examine the various options of how we might
  handle translations generally.
</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Option 1: Translations Live Within the Lesson Repo</h2>
<p>
  The first method of handling translations is to introduce
  a <code>translations</code> directory to the existing lesson
  templates. Under this directory would live translations other than
  original lesson using the ISO two-letter language code. The contents
  of these directories would be otherwise identical to those of the
  host lesson. This is how the Francisco has implemented his
  translation, on a fork of the <code>bc</code>
  repo. The <a href="https://progit.org/translations">ProGit Book</a>
  initially started out with this implementation, later moving to
  Option 3.
</p>
<p>
  One possible drawback to this implementation is that original and
  translated lessons can drift apart with no indication of where the
  changes happened. Since most instructors will be monolingual, they
  cannot <code>diff</code> the content. Since this lesson would live
  inside the official Software Carpentry structure, it would have a
  certain endorsement associated with it.
</p>
<h2>Option 2: Translations Live Within a Separate Branch</h2>
<p>
  Branches could be created of the form <code>trans-ISOCODE</code> or
  similar naming from the existing lessons. This would improve the
  ability to track the master language of the lesson and rebase
  changes (which would then need to be translated) as the lesson is
  updated.
</p>
<p>
  This implementation would resolve the <code>diff</code> issue in
  Option 1, allowing comparison of line-by-line changes, even if the
  content isn't understood. These translations, again living within an
  official repo, would have certain endorsement.
</p>
<h2>Option 3: Translations Live Within a Forked Repo</h2>
<p>
  Repositories containing translations could be forked from the main
  lesson and be maintained separately from the original. Changes would
  have to be merged from upstream and then translated.
</p>
<p>
  There are some examples of this implementation being successfully
  used, most notably
  the <a href="https://progit.org/translations">ProGit book</a>
  (thanks to W. Trevor King for the pointer). The forked repos are
  kept in sync with the upstream master book, and then translation
  commits are layered on top, for a sense of what that looks like,
  see <a href="https://github.com/progit/progit2-fr">progit-fr</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Forked repos could exist inside or outside the Software Carpentry
  organization, allowing for both officially endorsed and unofficial
  translations of lessons. If such translation efforts are wildly
  successful, this method would result in a massive proliferation of
  repositories, multiplying the increase due to the repo split.
</p>
<h2>How Official is a Translation?</h2>
<p>
  Integrating the translations into the lesson repository, either as
  Option 1 or Option 2, lends a certain endorsement of the quality and
  completeness of the translation. This may impose a burden on the
  lesson maintainers to either translate themselves (in the case where
  they have the ability) or attempt to seek out translators to
  maintain existing material. Barring that, they will have to decide
  when the core lesson has diverged too much from a translation, and
  "depreciate" the material.
</p>
<h2>Handing Translations on the Site</h2>
<p>
  Beyond storing translated lessons and keeping them in sync, we may
  want to render the lessons on the main Software Carpentry site. The
  existing lessons are rendered on the site under the
  path <code>v5/novice/lesson</code>. The existing pathing can be
  slightly modified to add the ISOCODE for the translation
  as <code>v6/ISOCODE/novice/lesson</code>. The lesson titles and
  descriptions will also need a custom page generated in the native
  language at <code>v6/ISOCODE/</code> so that they're appropriately
  indexed by Google.
</p>
<p>
  One last thing to consider is the detection
  of <code>Accept-Language</code> header sent by user's browser, and
  perhaps using that to recommend translated lessons if they navigate
  to the core lessons, this could bring larger awareness and usage to
  the translations, which is key to attracting more multi-lingual
  contributors.
