A new online book has recently been published that may be of interest to our community:

*[Tidy Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/)*

This book provides resources and examples for people who want to use
tidy tools from the R ecosystem to approach natural language
processing tasks. The intended audience for this book includes people
who don’t have extensive backgrounds in computational linguistics but
who need or want to analyze unstructured, text-heavy data. Using tidy
data principles can make text mining easier, more effective, and
consistent with tools already in wide use like dplyr, broom, and
ggplot2. Topics covered in the book include how to manipulate,
summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text, sentiment
analysis, tf-idf, and topic modeling.

The authors are still in the writing process and will be actively
developing and honing the book in the near future, but it already
contains many developed examples of using tidy data principles for
text analysis.

*Julia Silge* is a data scientist at Datassist where her work involves
analyzing and modeling complex data sets while communicating about
technical topics with diverse audiences. She has a Ph.D. in
astrophysics, as well as abiding affections for Jane Austen and making
beautiful charts. Julia worked in academia and ed tech before moving
into data science and discovering R.

*David Robinson* is a data scientist at Stack Overflow. He has a Ph.D.
in Quantitative and Computational Biology from Princeton University,
where he worked with Professor John Storey. His interests include
statistics, data analysis, genomics, education, and programming in R
and Python.
