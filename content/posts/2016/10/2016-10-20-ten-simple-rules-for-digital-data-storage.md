We are pleased to announce the publication of a new paper
whose author list includes several members of our community:

> for Digital Data
> Storage](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097)".

Their ten rules are:

1. Anticipate How Your Data Will Be Used
1. Know Your Use Case
1. Keep Raw Data Raw
1. Store Data in Open Formats
1. Data Should Be Structured for Analysis
1. Data Should Be Uniquely Identifiable
1. Link Relevant Metadata
1. Adopt the Proper Privacy Protocols
1. Have a Systematic Backup Scheme
1. The Location and Method of Data Storage Depend on How Much Data You Have

We hope you find it useful, and encourage you to follow in their
footsteps and write down what you know so that others can learn from
your experience.  As always, we are smarter together.
