The [Carter Lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-carter-lab) at 
The Jackson Laboratory is seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow in computational genetics 
and systems biology. Our group is developing novel computational methods to derive 
biological models from large-scale genomic data. The strategies we pursue 
involve combining statistical genetics concepts such as epistasis and 
pleiotropy to understand how many genetic and environmental factors combine 
to control disease-related processes in animal models and human studies. 
We are especially interested in dissecting the genetic complexity of 
autoimmune disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer.

[The Jackson Laboratory](http://www.jax.org) in Bar Harbor, Maine, USA, is 
recognized internationally for its excellence in research, unparalleled mouse 
resources, outstanding training environment characterized by scientific collaboration 
and exceptional core services - all within a spectacular setting adjacent to 
Acadia National Park. The Jackson Laboratory was voted among the top 15 
“Best Places to Work in Academia” in the United States in a poll conducted 
by The Scientist magazine.

Exceptional postdoctoral candidates will have the opportunity to apply to 
become a JAX Postdoctoral Scholar, a selective award addressing the national 
need for research scientists who are accomplished in the broadly defined 
fields of genetics and genomics. The award includes an independent research budget, 
travel funds, and a salary above standard postdoctoral scale.

Applicants for both positions must have a PhD (or equivalent degree) 
in quantitative biology or another quantitative discipline such as computer science, 
physics, or applied mathematics. Experience in statistical genetics and 
gene expression analysis is strongly recommended, and applicants 
must have a commitment to solving biological problems and good 
communication skills. Expertise in scientific programming languages 
including R, C/C++, Ruby, Perl, or Java is recommended. Expertise in 
cancer genetics, immunology, or neurological disease is desired but not required.
