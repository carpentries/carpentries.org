The [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) project based at the University
of California, Berkeley seeks to hire a postdoctoral scholar to work
on the research activities funded by the grant titled "Fostering the
next generation of sustainable software and reproducible research
practices in the scientific community". The project develops open
source software to promote reproducible research practices in the
scientific community. The postdoctoral scholar will focus on a
research topic aligned with their own interests in order to better
understand and improve scientific software practices. Possible topics
include but are not limited to:

*   Defining and evaluating sustainability for research software

*   Improving the development process that leads to new, sustainable,
    reusable, and impactful software

*   Developing recommendations for the support and maintenance of
    existing software: engineering best practices, transparency,
    governance, business and sustainability

*   Building large and engaged user communities

*   Understanding and recommending policy changes to software credit,
    attribution, incentive, and reward; issues related to multiple
    organizations and multiple countries, such as intellectual
    property, licensing, and mechanisms and venues for publishing
    software, and the role of publishers

*   Improving education and training

*   Studying careers and profession institutional changes to support
    sustainable software such as promotion and tenure metrics, job
    categories and career paths

We expect the postdoc will disseminate their findings in the form of
blog posts, technical reports, workshop and conference talks and
papers, journal papers or software products, as appropriate for the
work and the applicant's own career goals.  While experience in
developing academic software may be helpful, many projects in the
areas above need not require software development experience.

The candidate can expect to work closely with mentors from the
rOpenSci project aligned with their interests, such as Dr. Karthik Ram
and Dr. Carl Boettiger (UC Berkeley), Dr. Jenny Bryan (University of
British Columbia), and Dr. Daniel S. Katz (University of Illinois), as
well as other members from the rOpenSci and UC Berkeley
communities. This position will be based at UC Berkeley, but
arrangements for working remotely may be available.

This research is funded by the rOpenSci project through a grant from
the Helmsely Trust. The initial appointment will be for 1 year,
full-time (100%), renewable for another year based on adequate
progress made in the first year. The position comes with a competitive
postdoc salary [plus benefits](http://vspa.berkeley.edu/postdoc-health-and-welfare-benefits),
as well as a generous yearly allowance for computing equipment,
conference travel, and other research expenses. Expected start date is
November 2016. Please contact Dr. Karthik Ram
<karthik.ram@berkeley.edu> with any informal questions about the
position before applying.

**Qualifications**:

*   Applicants must possess a PhD or equivalent degree by their start
    date (more details in the full job ad linked below).

*   Applicants from natural or social sciences, computer science,
    statistics or related disciplines are all welcome.
