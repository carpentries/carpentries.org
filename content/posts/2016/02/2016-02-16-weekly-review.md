##Highlights
* The [2016 Software Carpentry Foundation Steering Committee election]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/01/election-candidates.html) is on this week. Questions regarding the elections can be addressed to <election@software-carpentry.org>.
* Daniel Chen has written up a fantasticly informative interview-style post about the [challenges and opportunities associated with running Software Carpentry lessons as university course]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/swc-as-a-university-course.html). The post is well-worth the read as there are many different views and ideas that might be relevant in your own context.

##Collaborate
* Great feedback about our [collaboratively designed introductory Python lesson]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/designing-lessons-collaboratively.html) has shaped much of what the lesson will look like. How should we proceed with actual development of the lesson? Let us know?
* Alex Konovalov and his colleagues are now [developing a Software Carpentry-style lesson on SageMath]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/new-lesson-on-gap.html). If you're interested to collaborate, please [get in touch](https://github.com/alex-konovalov/sage-lesson/issues/1).

##New
* Ashwin Srinath, a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University, is joining Gabriel Devenyi as [co-maintainer of the Unix Shell lessons]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/new-shell-maintainer.html). A big thanks to Christina and all the best to Ashwin!
* A [lesson on the computational algebra system GAP]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/new-lesson-on-gap.html) has been developed and taught by Alex Konovalov and his colleague
* A recent interview with Greg Wilson by Matthias Fromm and Konrad Förstner is now available as part of their [Open Science Radio podcasts]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/open-science-radio-podcast.html).

##Instructor training
* How well is Software Carpentry doing in conveying evidence-based teaching practices, specifically when measured against the [six core teaching strategies]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/long-way.html) published in 2007?

##Other
* Ian Hawke from the Centre for Doctoral Training in Next Generation Computational Modelling wrote about his experience in [providing context through the use of authentic examples]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/context-numerical-methods.html) during a recent numerical methods workshop.
* The [second](){{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/instructor-debriefing-round-02.html) and [third instructor debriefing session for 2016]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/instructor-debriefing-round-03.html) covered topics such as finding solutions for installation challenges, a collaborative blog writing excercise for git, wifi challenges, integration of SQL and Python lessons, and using real-world examples to encourage learning.
* We're comparing stats from [online versus in-person instructor training]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/correlations.html) from the last few years. Do you have any suggestions for correlations we could be looking at?
* The Kellogg Biological Station at Michigan State University is running a two-week course on [next generation sequencing data analysis]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/ngs-course-2016.html) for biologists on August 8-19, 2016.
* If you'd like to know how many workshops we've similtaneously ran on one day across the world you can now access the raw data or [visualise our activity over the last few years]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/active-workshops.html).
* What do we know about [usability and programming language design]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/02/two-pages-of-evidence.html)? Andreas Stefik and his colleagues have developed a two-pager summarising the knowledge that's out there.
* 16 workshops were run over the past 15 days. For more information about past workshops, please visit our [website]({{page.baseurl}}/workshops/past/)
