<p>
  It's been a depressing couple of weeks.
  On top of yet more reports of universities turning a blind eye to sexual harassment for years,
  a <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/1733/">new paper</a> of gender bias in open source
  shows that,
  "...women's contributions tend to be accepted more often than men's.
  However, when a woman's gender is identifiable, they are rejected more often."
  This comes on top of earlier studies
  (like <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~bvasiles/papers/socinfo12.pdf">this one</a>)
  showing that women are substantially under-represented in online forums like Stack Overflow,
  even when compared to computing as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  This prompted me to take another look at how Software Carpentry is doing.
  To start,
  here are the number and percentage of qualified Software Carpentry instructors
  broken down by gender:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Qualified Instructors by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>136</td><td>355</td><td>3</td><td>26</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>26.2%</td><td>68.3%</td><td>0.6%</td><td>5.0%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  Let's compare that to the number of people contributing to our core lesson repositories
  in January 2016
  by gender.
  (I'd like to show number for a whole year,
  but <a href="{{site.filesurl}}/swc_blog/2016/02/balance/bin/get-repo.py">my script</a>
  won't fetch stuff from that far back.)
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Repository Contributors by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>19</td><td>79</td><td>-</td><td>14</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>17.0%</td><td>70.5%</td><td>-</td><td>12.5%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  17% female is better than average for GitHub and Stack Overflow,
  but still pretty poor.
  The proportion is even worse when we count number of contributions
  rather than number of contributors:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Repository Contributions by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>69</td><td>532</td><td>-</td><td>28</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>11.0%</td><td>84.6%</td><td>-</td><td>4.5%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  This allows us to calculate contributions per person:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Repository Contributions per Person by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>3.6</td><td>6.7</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  But now let's compare this to the stats for Software Carpentry's core mission:
  delivering workshops.
  Our next table shows the number of people who taught workshops in 2015:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Workshop Instructors by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>89</td><td>193</td><td>121</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>21.9%</td><td>47.5%</td><td>29.8%</td><td>0.7%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  while this one shows the actual number of workshops taught
  (e.g., if I taught three times, I count as three points in the male column):
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Workshops Taught by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>182</td><td>406</td><td>163</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>24.1%</td><td>53.8%</td><td>21.6%</td><td>0.5%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  and this one shows the average number of workshops taught by each instructor:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Repository Contributions per Person by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>2.0</td><td>2.1</td><td>1.3</td><td>1.3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  Finally,
  here's the breakdown of contributors to our discussion mailing list
  for the three months Nov 2015 - Jan 2016:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Email Contributors by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>22</td><td>95</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>18.8%</td><td>81.2%</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  of messages sent:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Email Messages by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>73</td><td>277</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
  <tr><th>%age</th><td>20.9%</td><td>79.1%</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  and of messages per person:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Email Messages per Person by Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><th></th><th>Female</th><th>Male</th><th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Number</th><td>3.3</td><td>2.9</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  I draw some comfort from the fact that
  our online balance isn't dramatically different from our in-person balance,
  and that both are much better than GitHub's or Stack Overflow's
  (though it would be hard for us to do worse),
  It's still clear,
  though,
  that women and other people who do not identify as male are under-represented
  both online and in person.
  What's worse is that as we grow, we're regressing to computing's unbalanced mean:
  over a third of our instructors were women in the summer of 2013.
  While I worry about the number of people who complete instructor training but never teach for us,
  I worry a lot more about that,
  and if we're going to try to fix something this year,
  that's what I'd like it to be.
