## About Me

- B.Sc. Biology, Chemistry - Truman State University
- M.Sc. Biophysics - University of Wisconsin-Madison

- 3 years instructing with SWC; certified Fall 2014
- 9 SWC workshops organized/helped; 8 as an instructor
- 1 DC workshop organized/helped

**Relevant Volunteer Work**

- Social Media Manager for Midwest Ultimate, 2013-2014
- Science Editor and Writer for the Daily Cardinal, 2011-2012

**Currently**

Research Computing Facilitator at UW-Madison's large-scale computing center,
the Center for High Throughput Computing, where I lead user interaction efforts
and spend much of my time working directly with researchers to:

-   consult on computational research design
-   provide issue support
-   develop and deliver learning materials
-   match researchers to eachother and to additional resources

Beyond my direct work with researchers, I:

-   partake in design decisions for computational infrastructure
-   contribute to strategic initiatives to improve IT-related services for researchers 
-   advocate for researchers and their IT-related needs to campus administrators and other stakeholders

## Previous Contributions

Shortly after I started my current position, three years ago, I
began working with long-time SWC (and pre-SWC) advocates to
establish an ongoing schedule of SWC workshops at UW-Madison. To
this end, I continue to manage local workshop logistics and coordinate
our community of 15+ instructors and helpers. Prior to switching
to current SWC curricula in Aug 2015, I led the development
of experimental curricula with support from SWC leadership.
I otherwise work alongside Christina Koch, who serves as
a Shell curriculum maintainer and instructor trainer.

## Steering Committee Enthusiasm

I am passionate about enabling researchers to most-effectively leverage
computational tools and technology, in part, as a result of my own
struggles as a scientist. For this reason, I not only firmly believe in
the mission of SWC, but care deeply about ensuring the
organization's future.

Based upon experiences and expertise I have gained in my professional,
volunteer, and specific SWC activities,
I believe I can help to continue the success of the organization's
activities and its strong community of contributors. I have a demonstrated
interested in motivating participation within communities, appealing
to relevant stakeholders, and managing the execution of a range
of training efforts.

As SWC embarks on what I believe will be a period of significant
growth, I would be honored to contribute to strategic decisions that secure
the future of SWC's ability to empower researchers. I am
impressed with recent efforts to improve training and support for instructors,
and look forward to any opportunity to share my own ideas, including
encouragement of peer training from SWC's
most effective instructors and rewarding significant contributions
to curricula and documentation. In order to make stronger arguments to
existing and potential partners, I believe SWC
can invest in strategies to leverage support from attendees and from leaders
in research. These strategies will be essential to
securing the organization's financial sustainability, enabling SWC
to scale for the increasing demand for workshops and materials.
Furthermore, I look forward to more formally representing SWC, in part,
to manage perceptions of the brand by emerging stakeholders.

Because an organization like SWC is only as strong as its community,
let me know your thoughts! lmichael-AT-wisc.edu
