Hello fellow educators and coding enthusiasts! 
I'm terribly excited to offer myself as a candidate for the Software Carpentry Steering Committee. 
See below for answers to a few questions you might have about whether I'd be a good fit.

Who are you?
-----

I'm an assistant professor at the 
[University of Texas at Tyler](https://www.uttyler.edu/biology/faculty/hertweck.php) 
in small but diverse Biology Department. My position is officially described as bioinformaticist, 
but I specialize in comparative genomics and collaborate on many different types of 
biological data analysis. I teach graduate and undergraduate classes in bioinformatics, genomics, 
and plant taxonomy.

Don't I know you from somewhere?
-----

Perhaps! I was trained as an instructor in fall 2014, taught three workshops in 2015, 
and attended Data Carpentry's Genomics Hackathon last spring. 
If you checked out the Instructor Retreat last fall, you may also recognize me from the 
session on [assessing student performance using Socrative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb6fk_L35jk). 

Most of my involvement over the last year has been through serving on the mentoring subcommittee. 
If you've attended a debriefing discussion after teaching a workshop, chances are good that I was one of your hosts 
and/or helped write a [blog post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/01/instructor-debriefing-round-01.html) 
summarizing those sessions. I'm also coordinating 
[pre-workshop help sessions](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/01/pre-workshop-help.html) 
for instructors preparing to teach.  

How can you help Software Carpentry?
-----

My work on the mentoring subcommittee has given me a deep appreciation for the particular 
challenges faced by both our instructors and workshop attendees. There are four main areas 
I'd like to target as a member of the Steering Committee this upcoming year:

1. **Instructor preparation:** Many instructors are noting similar difficulties in debriefing 
sessions. While there are many resources to help plan for workshops, I would like to help 
instructors sift through this multitude of information to help their lessons go as smoothly as 
possible. This includes streamlining information available and fielding questions during 
pre-workshop help sessions.
2. **Teaching for HPC:** Software Carpentry skills are especially important in my subdiscipline, 
as they are essential for analysis using high performance computing resources. I'm interested in 
developing lessons that will help entry-level coders use compute clusters.
3. **Assessing student adoption of skills:** Assessment is definitely a hot topic right now! 
In addition to basic metrics of student learning from our workshops, I'm keenly interested in 
assessing which and with what frequency skills are adopted by student learners into their 
scientific workflows. Moreover, what is the best recommendation we can give for helping students 
continue learning on their own? Attend another workshop? Join a coding working group?
4. **Community and inclusivity:** A large part of what I appreciate about Software Carpentry 
is the sense of community and willingness to embrace diversity and inclusivity. 
As a member of the Steering Committee, I would keep these values at the forefront of my mind 
as we develop policies, especially in relation to audiences who may otherwise feel isolated 
(culturally, geographically, or otherwise).

Why do you want to serve on the steering committee?
-----

Software Carpentry brings rays of sunshine into my work life on a weekly basis. No joke! 
This group has been essential for my career development, both as a scientist and 
educator. I want to contribute more to this group. Given that the pedagogical methods of 
Software Carpentry dovetail nicely with many of the semester-long courses I teach, 
service on the Steering Committee could be an important source for my career development, 
so it really is a win-win situation! 

How can I learn more?
-----

I'm easily stalk-able on the intertubes! You can find me on twitter as [@k8hert](https://twitter.com/k8hert), 
[GitHub](https://github.com/k8hertweck), and I have both a (sorely neglected) [blog](http://k8hert.blogspot.com) and 
[research/teaching website](https://sites.google.com/site/k8hertweck/). I'm generally happy to talk 
to other folks passionate about these same sorts of topics, so feel free to drop me a line!
