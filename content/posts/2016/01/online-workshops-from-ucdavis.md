We have been experimenting with half-day workshops on specialized topics
that are broadcast over the web.
They have been [going very well](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-d3.js-annoc.html),
so we are planning to do more in the first half of 2016,
with about half of them broadcast this way.
The tentative schedule is below;
all workshops will run 9:15am-12:15pm, Pacific Time.
If you would like to present something yourself in one of the open slots,
please [file an issue](https://github.com/dib-lab/dib-training/issues)
or leave a comment on [this post](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-training-for-q12-2016.html) ---
we think this could be a really good way to field-test new material
that Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry instructors could use for more advanced audiences.
