Back in October,
[Sarah Sharp](http://sarah.thesharps.us/) posted a really useful article titled
"[What makes a good community?](http://sarah.thesharps.us/2015/10/06/what-makes-a-good-community/)".
In it,
she divided online tech communities into six levels
(numbered from zero, of course)
according to how welcoming and supportive they are.
I would put Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry in Level 1,
and say that we're starting to do meaningful work toward Level 2.
I would appreciate feedback of two kinds:

1.  If you agree,
    what should we do in 2016 to get to Level 2?
2.  If you don't,
    where are we falling short of Level 1 (or Level 0)?
