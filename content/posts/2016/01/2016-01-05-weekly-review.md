####Upcoming events

####Instructor Training
* [New procedures]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/instructor-training-checkout-procedure.html) have been developed to qualify as Software and Data Carpentry instructor.
* Feedback from the [three varieties of instructor training]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/three-flavors-of-instructor-training.html) that were put to the test in 2015 is now available.
* Billy Charlton from Puget Sound Regional Council, used the [online Software Carpentry materials to prepare]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/pushing-ahead-in-puget-sound.html) for teaching his first Software Carpentry lesson this past December.
  If you've been on the instructor training waiting list for long, his blog gives good pointers to get going.
