At the end of last year
[we announced a new checkout procedure for instructor training]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/12/instructor-training-checkout-procedure.html).
This new procedure has "an hour-long group discussion led by an experienced instructor"
and we are looking for instructors interested in lead the sessions.

<!--more-->

If you taught at least two Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshops in 2015
or made significant contributions to the lessons
we will love to have you leading some of the sessions.

The sessions will be one hour long, and we would prefer to run them in pairs
(i.e., one in the morning and one in the evening of the same day of **instructor local time**)
in order to accommodate participants' time zones.

If you want to help us with the sessions please fill
