The Software Carpentry Foundation Steering Committee held a strategic planning
meeting in August. In that two-day, intensive meeting, we focused on developing
a long term strategic plan for the Software Carpentry Foundation.  The process
emphasized identification of our stakeholders and mission. It also used the
results of [our community
survey](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/07/scf-swot-survey.html) to
identify our strengths and weaknesses as well as the opportunities and threats
that face the organization. The resulting Strategic Plan was developed over the
course of the in-person meeting and summarized into a document. With vital
feedback from the Advisory Council, whose role is to offer advice and guidance
to SCF on strategic matters, we arrived at the document that now resides
[here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/strategy/strategic_plan.md).

One highlight is our brief Mission Statement:

> We aim to teach skills that promote reproduciblility and reliability in
> research. To accomplish this, we focus on educating and supporting instructors,
> developing curricula and running workshops.

Based on Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats identified by the
community, as well as a lengthy assessment of our stakeholders and mission, the
Steering Committee arrived at the following major strategic issues that will be
our primary focus for the near term.  Some of the nearest term goals have
already moved forward since the development of the plan (such as the new
website design, which contributes to reporting and transparency).

- Reporting and Transparency
- Documentation of Procedures
- Instructor Pipeline Management
- Coordination with Data Carpentry

More information about the detailed meaning of these issues can be found [in
the document
itself](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/strategy/strategic_plan.md).

Rather than a top-down declaration of our goals as a foundation, we intended
this document to capture what we understood to be the ideas and missions of _you_,
our community. As you look over this document, we hope you won’t hesitate to
provide feedback that will help SCF clarify its mission, nurture its strengths,
and reach its aspirations. If you have any questions or suggestions, we hope
you'll get in touch through comments on this post. 

Even better, if you’d like to be instrumental in the annual revision of this
strategic plan, please consider [running for the 2016 Steering
Committee.](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/12/call-for-candidates-elections-2016.html) 
The deadline is this Friday.
