Are you preparing to teach a workshop in a few months? 
Have you been trained as an instructor but are hesitant to sign up to teach? 
Has it been awhile since you taught and are interested in learning what's new in a lesson? 
Are you thinking about teaching a new (or just new-to-you) lesson?

The mentoring subcommittee is pleased to announce the institution of regularly scheduled 
help sessions for folks who are interested in feedback on their workshop plans. 
The first hangouts of 2016 are planned for Wednesday, January 20 at 10:00 and 19:00 EST 
and are open to the entire community. You can view possible topics for discussion and 
sign up to attend on the etherpads for the [morning](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/pre-workshop-morning) 
and [evening](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/pre-workshop-evening) sessions. 
These discussions are planned for every two weeks and will be included on the 
[community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com). 

Please consider coming to join us, either to share your own experiences, troubleshoot lessons, 
or receive feedback about what you have planned for an upcoming workshop. We are hoping these 
sessions will be an informal, friendly place to help instructors streamline the process of workshop 
implementation.
