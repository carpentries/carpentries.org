</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p>
  This Fall, I am teaching graduate-level biostatistics. I have not
  had the good fortune of teaching many graduate-level offerings, and
  I am really excited to do so. A team of top-notch big data
  scientists are hosted
  at <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">NCEAS</a>. They have
  recently formed a really exciting collaborative-learning collective
  entitled <a href="http://eco-data-science.github.io/">ecodatascience</a>. I
  was also aware of the mission
  of <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>
  but had not reviewed the materials. The ecodatascience collective
  recently hosted
  a <a href="http://remi-daigle.github.io/2016-04-15-UCSB/">carpentry
  workshop</a>, and I attended. I am a parent and
  use <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">common sense
  media</a> as a tool to decide on appropriate content. As a tribute
  to that tool and the efforts of the ecodatascience instructors, here
  is a brief common sense review.

<p><strong>What You Need to Know</strong></p>

<p>
  You need to know that the materials, approach, and teaching provided
  through software carpentry are a perfect example of contemporary,
  pragmatic, practice-what-you-teach instruction. Basic coding skills,
  common tools, workflows, and the culture of open science were
  clearly communicated throughout the two days of instruction and
  discussion, and this is a clear 5/5 rating. Contemporary ecology
  should be collaborative, transparent, and reproducible. It is not
  always easy to embody this. The use of GitHub and RStudio
  facilitated a very clear signal of collaboration and documented
  workflows.
</p>
<p>
  All instructors were positive role models, and both men and women
  participated in direct instruction and facilitation on both days.
  This is also a perfect rating. Contemporary ecology is not about
  fixed scientific products nor an elite, limited-diversity set of
  participants within the scientific process. This workshop was a
  refreshing look at how teaching and collaboration have
  changed. There were also no slide decks. Instructors worked directly
  from RStudio, GitHub Desktop app, the web, and gh-pages pushed to
  the browser. It worked perfectly. I think this would be an ideal
  approach to teaching biostatistics.
</p>
<p>
  Statistics are not the same as data wrangling or coding. However,
  data science (wrangling &amp; manipulation, workflows, meta-data,
  open data, &amp; collaborative analysis tools) should be clearly
  explained and differentiated from statistical analyses in every
  statistics course and at least primer level instruction provided in
  data science. I have witnessed significant confusion from
  established, senior scientists on the difference between data
  science/management and statistics, and it is thus critical that we
  communicate to students the importance and relationship between both
  now if we want to promote data literacy within society.
</p>
<p>
  There was no sex, drinking, or violence during the course :).
  Language was an appropriate mix of technical and colloquial so I
  gave it a positive rating, i.e. I view 1 star as positive as you
  want some colloquial but not too much in teaching precise data
  science or statistics. Finally, I rated consumerism at 3/5, and I
  view this an excellent rating. The instructors did not overstate the
  value of these open science tools – but they could have and I wanted
  them to! It would be fantastic to encourage everyone to adopt these
  tools, but I recognize the challenges to making them work in all
  contexts including teaching at the undergraduate or even graduate
  level in some scientific domains.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bottom line</strong> for me – no slide decks for biostats
  course, I will use GitHub and push content out, and I will share
  repo with students. We will spend one third of the course on data
  science and how this connects to statistics, one third on connecting
  data to basic analyses and documented workflows, and the final
  component will include several advanced statistical analyses that
  the graduate students identify as critical to their respective
  thesis research projects.
</p>
<p>
  I would strongly recommend that you attend a workshop model similar
  to the work of Software Carpentry and the ecodatascience
  collective. I think the best learning happens in these contexts. The
  more closely that advanced, smaller courses emulate the workshop
  model, the more likely that students will engage in active research
  similarly. I am also keen to start one of these collectives within
  my department, but I suspect that it is better lead by more junior
  scientists.
</p>
<p>
  Net rating of workshop is <strong>5 stars</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Age</strong> at 14+ (kind of a joke), but it is a proxy for
  competency needed. This workshop model is best pitched to those that
  can follow and read instructions well and are comfortable with a
  little drift in being lead through steps without a simplified slide
  deck.
