On May 8th and 9th the Steering Committee had an in-person meeting at Cold
Spring Harbour Laboratory to conclude the discussions during the first
two months and make plans for the next ten months of activities.
In the following weeks we will write more about the results of the in-person
meeting on the blog but for now we want to give you an overview.

## Partnerships

Our Executive Director is doing an amazing job increasing the number of Software
Carpentry [partners](http://software-carpentry.org/scf/partners/). Last year,
we were asked to provide a join partnership agreement with [Data
Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/)
and after months of work this agreement is now
[available](http://software-carpentry.org/scf/join/).

## Instructor Training

Last year we tried several models for Instructor Training
that now are more stable and are [available here]({{site.training_url}})
thanks to the work of our Instructor Trainers.

We will continue improving our Instructor Training programme
and increasing our capacity to high demand.

## Subcommittees and Task Forces

Last year we accomplished many things only because of our amazing community.
This year we can help you, including financially, to shape Software Carpentry and for that we [opened a
call for subcommittees and task
forces](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/04/subcommittes-taskforces.html).

## Communication

Communication is our greatest weakness and we are going to work really hard to
improve it. (**This post is part of this goal.**) Something that we decided
during the in-person meeting was provide [an official space on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/17942228448/) because on some
countries and some audiences this is the first place that they will look for us.

We will also create an Instagram account to display and share photographs from
Software Carpentry workshops and activities.

## Diversity

We will continue to support a diverse community and healthy spaces for
communication. We have a [Code of
Conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct) to help with that.

## Future Directions

We will continue to work close with other communities that are aligned with our
vision and mission.
