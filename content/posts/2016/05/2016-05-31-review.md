The [joint partnership agreement]({{page.baseurl}}/scf/join/) with Data Carpentry is now available, together with a [written version of the instructor training model]({{site.training_url}}), a [call for subcommittees and task forces]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/04/subcommittes-taskforces.html), and an [official space on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/17942228448/).

##Instructor training
* The results from the [first analysis of instructor training data]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/05/first-analysis.html) is now available. Also see the [discussion](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/004509.html) on the discuss mailing list. If you have a [suggestion for further analysis]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/05/looking-for-a-model.html), please share your thoughts!
* Applications for [R instructor training in Cambridge, UK,]({{page.baseurl}}/blog/2016/05/r-instructor-training.html) are now open. 
* Beth Duckles have recently published two reports on Software Carpentry instructors' experiences and views. In a more recent blog she's asking whether we are [measuring the things that we actually care about](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/004472.html).
