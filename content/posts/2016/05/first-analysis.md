Following up on [Wednesday's post about instructor training stats]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2016/05/looking-for-a-model.html),
Erin Becker (Data Carpentry's new Associate Director) has [posted an analysis](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/instructor-metrics/).
I was very surprised to discover that less than 20% of people trained over a year ago haven't taught yet:
I believed the number to be much higher.
51% of those trained in the last 12 months haven't taught yet,
but that's less surprising, since in many cases there simply hasn't been time.
Overall,
we seem to be doing pretty well...
