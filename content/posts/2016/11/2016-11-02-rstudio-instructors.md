[RStudio](http://rstudio.com) maintains [a directory](https://www.rstudio.com/instructors/)
of people who provide training and consulting for R using their flagship product.
If you have taught R for Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry,
have an established training and/or consulting practice,
can provide some positive references from previous clients,
please contact [Garrett Grolemund](mailto:garrett@rstudio.com) about adding your profile.
