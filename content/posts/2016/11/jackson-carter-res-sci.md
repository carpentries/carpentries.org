The Carter Lab at The Jackson Laboratory is seeking an Associate Research Scientist in the genetics of Alzheimer’s
disease. [Our group] (https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-carter-lab) is developing novel
computational methods to derive biological models from large-scale genomic data. The strategies we pursue involve
combining statistical genetics concepts such as epistasis and pleiotropy to understand how many genetic factors
combine to control disease-related processes in neurodegeneration. We are therefore seeking an individual with
expertise in epistasis analysis as it pertains to studies of Alzheimer’s genetics in humans.

The [Jackson Laboratory] (http://www.jax.org) in Bar Harbor, Maine, USA, is recognized internationally for its
excellence in research, unparalleled mouse resources, outstanding training environment characterized by scientific
collaboration, and exceptional core services - all within a spectacular setting adjacent to Acadia National Park.
The Jackson Laboratory was voted among the top 15 “Best Places to Work in Academia” in the United States in a poll
conducted by The Scientist magazine.

Broad skills in statistical genetics, the genetics of human disease, and Alzheimer’s etiology are required.
Applicants must have a commitment to solving biological problems and communicating these solutions.

Applicants should have a PhD. in the computational sciences, and postdoctoral experience related to bioinformatics
and computational biology, particularly as it relates to Alzheimer's disease. Candidates should have a record of
scientific achievements including journal publications and conference presentations.

Please contact Dr. Greg Carter directly at gregory.carter (at) jax.org using the subject line "SWC research scientist ad".
