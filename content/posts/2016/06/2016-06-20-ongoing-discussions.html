  We've been using GitHub issues to manage discussions for the last eighteen months or so.
  It's working pretty well:
  when something on the main mailing list looks like it's going to run for a while,
  we push the conversation over to GitHub
  so that people who want to go into more detail can do so
  without flooding other people's mailboxes.
</p>
<p>
  I've being going through those discussion issues
  while tidying up our lessons for their next release,
  and found a few that are still relevant,
  but which never reached a resolution.
  If you have thoughts on any of these,
  please go ahead add your comments&mdash;if your ideas don't get folded into the lessons this time,
  they will next.
