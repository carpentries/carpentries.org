## Calling all Software Carpentry workshop attendees! 

I’d like 10 minutes of your time to complete a 
[survey](https://survey.its.uq.edu.au/Checkbox/Software-Carpentry-Trainee-Survey.aspx)
about the Software Carpentry workshop you attended.

**Why should you bother?**

The data will be useful for Software Carpentry in the future planning of workshops.

While individual Software Carpentry workshops are assessed at the time of delivery, 
no long term follow-up study has been done on the efficacy of the training delivered, 
nor of any impact the training might have had on attendees’ work practices, 
further skills acquisition, or subsequent career paths. 

I am now proposing to do that follow-up for an MPhil project at 
[The University of Queensland](http://www.uq.edu.au/) entitled “The Efficacy and Usefulness of Software Carpentry Training”. 

The [survey](https://survey.its.uq.edu.au/Checkbox/Software-Carpentry-Trainee-Survey.aspx) is the **first phase** of a two-phase study. 

All Software Carpentry workshop attendees are invited to complete it. 
It should take no more than 10 minutes to answer. 

It will capture information about workshops as well as demographic information 
(confidentiality is assured, and people don't have to identify themselves 
if they don’t want to). Space is provided for attendees to write at 
length (if they want to) about their experiences, both good and bad.

The **second phase** will involve in-depth interviews with people prepared 
to talk further about their experiences of Software Carpentry training. 
If that is you, I would *love* to hear from you. 
You can contact me directly at `thesiscarpentry` AT `gmail.com`

Thank you in advance !
