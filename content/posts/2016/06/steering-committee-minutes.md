The Steering Committee informs that the minutes of their last meeting held last week
are now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/minutes/minutes-2016-06-16.md).

As the Secretary,
I'm sorry for the delay to release the minutes of the meetings
due some experiments on the workflow to write the minutes.
Now I'm happy with the workflow that we have in place
that will assign one ID for all our motions
making easy for us to refer them.
I still want to make a few improvements on the workflow
to make the minutes more machine redable.

If you critics and suggestions related to the minutes
please send those by email to me at [raniere@rgaics.com](mailto:raniere@rgaiacs.com).
