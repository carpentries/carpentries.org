    After becoming an instructor,
    <strong>Christina Koch</strong>
    immediately started taking on extra responsibilities.  She has taught
    countless workshops, been a lesson maintainer, played a major role in
    the mentoring committee, and become an instructor trainer.

    then became certified as an instructor.  Since then she has organized
    workshops in conjunction with events like PyConZA, going from four

    <strong>Jon Pipitone</strong>
    was our unofficial system administrator from 2010 to 2016.  In that
    time, he managed our servers, took care of backups and mailing lists,
    and generally kept the lights on. Jon's work was not directly visible
    to most of our community, but was essential to keeping us afloat.
