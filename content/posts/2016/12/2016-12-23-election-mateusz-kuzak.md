Hi, I’m standing up for election to the Software Carpentry Steering
Committee 2017.

# Me & Carpentries
My background is life science. I currently work at the Netherlands
eScience Center in Amsterdam. Apart from being a developer on various
research software projects, I’m involved in Center’s training
activities and software development best practices.

I got sucked into  in Software Carpentry world through Elixir Data
Carpentry Pilot organised by Aleksandra Pawlik. During hackathon in
Helsinki, together with Francois Michonneau and few other people we
kickstarted `ggplot2` part in `R-ecology-lesson`.  From day one I
learned a lot about the mechanics of SC, lesson development and
logistics of the workshops.

## Instructor
At the end of 2015, I attended instructor training in Manchester and
became certified instructor shortly after. Since then I instructed
at 7 SC and DC workshops around Europe and few more eScience Center
workshops based on Software or Data Carpentry materials. Currently,
I’m learning towards becoming an instructor trainer.

## Mentoring
Recently I started joining instructor discussions as an observer and
I’m planning on becoming host next year. I also joined recently
announced mentorship program.

## Library Carpentry
With small group of people in Amsterdam we hosted site for Mozilla
Science Global Sprint and joined groups around the world in the
effort to migrate Data Carpentry lessons to Library Carpentry.
I have been contributing to LC materials since then.


## Netherlands and Europe
I see how powerful Carpentries training model is and how important
it is to establish Carpentries communities in the Netherlands and
Europe. I have been relentlessly promoting SC, from local Research
Software Engineers meetings (DTL programmers meetings) to conferences
(BioSB). I helped establish eScience Center and Software Carpentry
Partnership and work together with SURF (the collaborative ICT
organisation for Dutch education and Research) on wider partnerships
within the Netherlands.

ELIXIR is very close to finalising the partnership with SC/DC and
next year multiple SC and DC workshops will be organised for life
science researchers in ELIXIR nodes. It has become apparent that
there is a need for bioinformatics lesson. Together with other
people from other ELIXIR nodes, we are planning to test drive and
contribute to
[Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop)
through series of hackathons in the Netherlands, Portugal and UK.

# Plans for Steering Committee
I think it’s very important that there is someone on the committee
to give the European perspective. The culture differs here from North
America. The scale is different too, it easier to connect / partner
with other countries and European Union projects. I plan to help
establishing the partnership with SURF in the Netherlands and
multiple smaller partnerships around the Netherlands. I will also
continue connecting various European projects with Carpentries
initiative. One example is establishing  SC workshops as part of
H2020 European Training Programs (ETPs). eScience Center is
currently contributing to two of those.
I know how important it is to build sustainable local instructor
community and realise how low is the instructor certification rate.
I hope to contribute to improving it through mentorship program but
also local study groups.
