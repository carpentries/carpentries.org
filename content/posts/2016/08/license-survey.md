You are invited to participate in a survey on software licensing
designed to investigate how well software developers understand common
open source software licenses. We are looking for software developers
that have built or are currently building on open source software in
their projects (and I am personally interested in hearing from people
building open source software for research).  The study is being
conducted by Prof. Gail Murphy (murphy@cs.ubc.ca) and graduate student
Daniel Almeida (daa@cs.ubc.ca); participating in the anonymous online
survey will take approximately 30 minutes. If you are interested in
participating, please go to:

If you have any questions, please contact us at
[daa@cs.ubc.ca](mailto:daa@cs.ubc.ca).
