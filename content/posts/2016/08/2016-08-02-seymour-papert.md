[Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) passed away on Sunday at the age of 88.
I never had the privilege of meeting him,
but Software Carpentry would probably never have existed
if I hadn't stumbled across
his inspirational book *[Mindstorms](https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746/)*.
You can read more about his life and work [here](http://news.mit.edu/2016/seymour-papert-pioneer-of-constructionist-learning-dies-0801);
when you're done,
please go and help someone learn something&mdash;I think he'd have liked that.
