  As we <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2014/12/standing-for-election.html">announced last year</a>,
  an election will be held on January 26-30
  for the seven positions on the Steering Committee of the Software Carpentry Foundation.
  If you are a qualified instructor who has taught at least twice in the past two years,
  or have done a significant chunk of non-teaching work for Software Carpentry,
  you can both stand for election and vote.
  We strongly urge you to consider standing:
  if you're willing and able to commit to giving the Foundation 3 hours a week,
  you'll help thousands of scientists.
  It'll be fun, too:
  few things in life are more satisfying than working with a dedicated bunch of people
  to make something useful happen.
</p>
<p>
  In order to stand for election,
  you must write a blog post to introduce yourself to the community
  by <strong>Friday, January 16</strong>.
  This post must be around 500 words long,
  can be written in any format (e.g. question and answer, paragraph text),
  and must be titled, "2015 Election: Your Name".
  It should explain:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      what your background is,
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      what your previous involvement with Software Carpentry has been,
      and most importantly
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      what you will do as a member of the Steering Committee
      to contribute to the growth and success of Software Carpentry.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
