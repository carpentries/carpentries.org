  I've been an instructor since September 2013 and have taught 10
  workshops so far. I'm finishing a master's in Science Communication
  and work at the <a href="https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">Martinos
  Center for Biomedical Imaging</a>.  I would propose three things to
  the new Committee: <strong>improve our outreach and communication
  strategies</strong>, <strong>expand Software Carpentry to other
  regions and languages</strong>, and <strong>strengthen the mentoring
  program for new instructors</strong>.

  I'm probably one of the least computer-inclined instructors in the
  whole pool. Back when I was doing my BSc in Physics in Spain, I
  didn't like computers much. I got my first one as a freshman and the
  only programming class I took was an awful intro to numerical
  analysis in FORTRAN.
</p>
<p>
  Two years in my PhD, I realized computer simulations are handy in
  real life and that the elegance of the analytical approach comes
  also with some vacuity (cows are not always spherical, you know). I
  implemented a Monte Carlo in Mathematica and felt proud. My Russian
  friend Alexei thought different (<em>"Mathematica is a black
  box!"</em>) and encouraged me to learn a "real" programming
  language. I took a class on C++ and discovered that
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Generic-Programming-Alexander-Stepanov/dp/0321942043">programming is pretty</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Armed with my new vision and class, I took a post-doc at Oak Ridge
  National Lab in a computational physics group to work in a
  new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group">algorithm
  that gives exact solutions for quantum systems with reduced
  dimensionality</a>. I also thought that programming would be handy
  if I ever had to apply for a real job.
</p>
<p>
  After couple of weeks in Oak Ridge, a fellow postdoc handed me a toy
  C++ implementation of the algorithm. I never told this to anyone,
  but I spent that day trying to compile it using <code>gcc</code>
  instead of <code>g++</code>. (Short story, doesn't work).
</p>
<p>
  From this start you can imagine the pain: countless hours in the
  vicious cycle of writing buggy code, throwing it to the compiler,
  which inevitably buried me with errors or seg faults.  I got
  everything working nicely at some point and became a "competent
  programmer", but I still doubt whether it was worth it.
</p>
<p>
  Years later, I found out Software Carpentry on the web. I started
  devouring Greg's videos and wondering why nobody had told me all
  that before. I learnt lots, realizing I wasn't as "competent" as I
  thought.
</p>
  The truth is many still think that computer skills is something that
  scientists have <em>somehow</em> built in.  That's why I would ask
  the new Committee to <strong>improve our communication
  strategies</strong>. I think we need to reach out further and to
  different audiences, not only <strong>scientists</strong> looking to
  improve their skills, but also <strong>lab
  managers</strong>, <strong>program
  administrators</strong>, <strong>university departments</strong>,
  and <strong>the press</strong>. And maybe to other groups: there had
  been workshops for librarians, but what about data journalists?
</p>
<p>
  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-silva.html">Like
  Raniere</a>, I would like to <strong>expand Software Carpentry
  geographically</strong>. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/workshops/past/">Most
  workshops happen in English-speaking countries</a>, even outside
  North America: there was a bunch in the UK, but just one in
  Spain. Sure is because of the awesome people pushing in these places
  like <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-pawlik.html">Aleksandra</a>,
  Giacomo
  or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-irving.html">Damien</a>,
  but I also think that the language barrier comes into play. I'd like
  to push translation of Software Carpentry materials, continuing the
  on-going efforts in Portuguese and Spanish.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, as many other candidates, I want to <strong>strengthen our
  mentoring program for new instructors</strong>. When I taught the
  first times, I felt a disconnect between intructor training and
  what's needed in a real workshop.  With more new instructors coming
  and others teaching after a while, a stronger mentoring program
  would be beneficial for all.
