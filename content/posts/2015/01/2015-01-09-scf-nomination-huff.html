Software Carpentry has been part of my life for over six years, I began as 
  an instructor, organizer, and curriculum developer and have 
  been honored to grow as a researcher alongside Software Carpentry as it 
  evolved over that time. In these years, I have organized 
  and taught over a dozen workshops and have, for the last four months, served 
  as an interim Steering Committee member. I have also made an effort to expand 
  the reach of Software Carpentry as a co-author of both 
  <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745">the Best Practices paper</a> 
  and a new O'Reilly book, 
  <a href="http://physics.codes">"Effective Computation in Physics: Field Guide to 
    Research in Python."</a>
  Of course, none of this pays the bills.  For that, 
  I am a nuclear engineer...

<h3>Background</h3>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WNQdUcr8fIQ/U_OUqdW8UdI/AAAAAAAAHCU/kB1UmSXOlbI/s536-no/katy_huff_shark_sm.png" style="width:100px;height:100px" />
<p>
  My scientific background includes a BA in Physics (University of Chicago, 
  2008) and a PhD in Nuclear Engineering (University of Wisconsin - Madison, 
  2013). I am currently a postdoc in Nuclear Engineering at the University of 
  California, Berkeley.  There, I am a fellow within 
  <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu">the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)</a> 
  and a postdoctoral scholar with 
  <a href="https://st.llnl.gov/partnerships/academia-and-gov/nssc">the Nuclear Science and Security Consortium</a>.
  Currently, I investigate safety and sustainability in advanced nuclear 
  reactors and systems using multiphysics simulation and agent-based modeling, 
  respectively.
</p>
<h3>Involvement</h3>
<p>
  Of course, my path was strongly influenced by Software Carpentry. In 2008, as 
  a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, I helped to found a 
  peer-instruction group called <a href="https://thehackerwithin.github.io">The 
    Hacker Within</a>.  This group shares many of the same goals as Software 
  Carpentry, conducts weekly meetings for skill-sharing, and, at the University 
  of Wisconsin, conducted occasional large workshops on programming practices 
  and languages. When my PhD advisor, Paul Wilson, introduced us to Greg's 
  Software Carpentry concepts in a video online, we were inspired to create a 
  Software Carpentry workshop on our own.  Greg soon thereafter stumbled upon it online and 
  emailed us.  An incredible friendship was formed and THW material seeded much 
  of the workshop material we are still using today in Software Carpentry.
  My involvement since then as an instructor, organizer, and curriculum 
  developer has allowed me to stand in front of hundreds of students, hone my 
  teaching skills, meet innumerable wonderful people, and serve as a member of 
  the interim Steering Committee. 
</p>
<h3>Commitment</h3>
<p>
  When Software Carpentry became an independent foundation, I was thrilled to 
  become part of the interim Steering Committee. I served in many ways: by 
  signing the official Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement with NumFocus, electing 
  Greg as our Executive Director, hashing over budgets, advocating Software 
  Carpentry, drafting many of the documents now guiding nascent SCF actions, 
  and much more.
</p>
<p>
  If elected to the 2015 Steering Committee, I would be pleased to take on any 
  role. That said, the role of Secretary would be of most interest to me. I 
  have served successfully as an executive committee member, secretary, 
  treasurer, vice-chair, and chair of many organizations. Some of the 
  organizations that I have helped to lead include The Hacker Within at 
  <a href="https://thehackerwithin.github.io">Wisconsin</a> and <a 
    href="https://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley">Berkeley</a>, the 
  American Nuclear Society's <a href="http://fcwmd.ans.org/">Fuel Cycle and 
    Waste Management Division</a>, its <a href="http://ymg.ans.org">Young 
    Members Group</a>, <a href="https://nuclearpride.org">Nuclear Pride</a>, and others. Similarly, I have 
  demonstrated my dedication and efficacy as a community leader through two 
  years as <a 
    href="https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/organizers/">Technical Program 
    Co-Chair</a> of the SciPy Scientific Python Conference. 
</p>
<p>
  As a member of the Steering Committee, I will be dedicated to the sustainable 
  growth of the Software Carpentry community and its mission. As 
  Damien mentioned in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-irving.html">his candidacy announcement</a>, 
  this transition period for the SCF will be an important one that will require extraordinary 
  organization, cohesion, and dedication from its Steering Committee members. 
  As I have always strived to do, I intend to give generously of my time, 
  skills, social capital, and enthusiasm to move Software Carpentry forward 
  into a strong, sustainable era.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, if I am elected as Secretary, I hope to emphasize 
  <b>radical transparency</b> in Committee actions and communications. A key role for 
  the committee will be to communicate as effectively, inclusively, and clearly 
  as possible with the Software Carpentry community of instructors, learners, 
  and other stakeholders. In an analogy to open science, I hope to facilitate 
  those goals by ensuring transparent, multi-channel, multi-directional 
  communication among the members of the community in such a way that the 
  Steering Committee hears them and is, itself, heard.
</p>
<p>
  It would be impossible to overemphasize the impact Software Carpentry has had 
  on me as a researcher and a human. In return, I hope to continue to serve 
  this amazing community as a member of the Software Carpentry Steering 
  Committee. For more details, please check out my <a
