  Software Carpentry is a volunteer organisation whose goal is to make
  scientists more productive, and their work more reliable, by
  teaching them basic computing skills. Founded in 1998, it runs
  short, intensive workshops that cover program design, version
  control, testing, and task automation. In October 2014, a non-profit
  Software Carpentry Foundation was created to act as a governing body
  for the project.
</p>
<p>
  UCL is London's Global University, founded to open up education to
  all on equal terms. Today our outstanding research and innovative
  teaching drive entrepreneurial solutions to the world's major
  problems.
</p>
<p>
  UCL Research IT Services is UCL's organisation supporting and
  enabling computational research. Committed to sharing the most
  effective ways of using computers for research, we offer practical,
  hands-on training in high performance cluster computing and research
  software development. We are excited to be part of the Software
  Carpentry community, and organise Software Carpentry events for UCL
  students and research staff three times per year.
</p>
<p>
  By affiliating with the Software Carpentry Foundation, organisations
  demonstrate their commitment to teaching best practices for
  scientific computing, contribute charitably to support a sustainable
  future for the organisation, and help shape the future of digital
  research.

<p>
  UCL is proud to become an affiliate of the Software Carpentry Foundation.
