<p>
Software and Data Carpentry recently held their first ever Instructor + Helper Retreat. 
The aim of this event was to bring instructors and helpers together remotely and at local 
sites around the world for a day of sharing skills, trying out new lessons and ideas and
discussing all things instructor and helper related. This Retreat attempted to meet these 
goals via 17 local meetups in North America, Europe and Australia, 14 sessions broadcast 
globally via Google Hangouts on Air, and many people participating remotely by watching 
and asking questions at the global broadcast sessions.
</p>
<p>
In addition to bringing the 
community together, the Retreat also has generated additional resources surrounding many 
topics of interest to Software and Data Carpentry instructors and helpers; the global 
broadcast sessions are archived on YouTube (pending session leaders leaving them up) and 
can be watched at any time. The links to these videos are archived on the 
<a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/instructor-retreat-2015/">Retreat website</a>.

<h2>Who attended?</h2>
<p>
<a href="{{site.filesurl}}/swc_blog/2015/11/post-2015-retreat-survey-attendees.csv">Surveys</a>
to collect feedback from ~50 participants indicated that 64% of participants were 
Software or Data Carpentry Instructors, 17% were instructors in training, 9% were Helpers, 
and 6% identified themselves as not previously being associated with either Software or 
Data Carpentry prior to the retreat. Of the Instructors who completed the survey, 40% also
identified themselves as Content Contributors.</p>

<h2>How did people participate?</h2>
<p>The survey also provided some insight into how people actually participated at the 
Retreat. Most people participated in the Retreat through conversations (89%), round table
discussions (89%), watching Global Broadcast sessions (64%) and examining new teaching 
materials (42%). Fewer people participated by actively contributing or commenting on the 
global broadcast sessions (17%), practicing teaching (15%) or writing/reviewing material
(17%). Building community and expanding people's Software and Data Carpentry networks also 
was a big part of the Retreat, with 98% of survey participants stating that they met 
someone new. A breakdown of how many new people each survey participant met is below:

<h2>Retreat Expectations</h2>
<p>
We also asked survey participants for their expectations of the day and whether they were 
met. Expectations were broad, but common themes included meeting others from the Software 
and Data Carpentry community, learn more about Software and Data Carpentry, learn about 
and discuss material being developed, as well as discuss and practice teaching methods. 
74% of survey participants reported that the Retreat met or exceeded their expectations. </p>

<h2>Looking forward</h2>
