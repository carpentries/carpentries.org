  It's been knocking around for a while now, but this week saw a big
  new release of
  the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1482094">Open
  Research Glossary</a>, a crowdsourced glossary of terms, acronyms,
  tools and concepts in and around open science. There's a lot of
  jargon in this area and it's often a barrier to understanding for
  the uninitiated. For example: 'green', 'gold', 'diamond' and
  'hybrid' open access are shorthand terms which aren't always fully
  understood.
</p>
<p>
  The alphabet soup of acronyms are even worse!
  Take <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">SHERPA/RoMEO</a> for
  instance: it's a brilliant resource for checking author
  self-archiving rights relative to publisher-imposed restrictions and
  embargoes, but the name 'SHERPA/RoMEO' doesn't exactly make that
  clear. This glossary aims to elucidate all the need-to-know terms in
  open scholarship.

  The glossary compilation was initiated earlier in the year by myself
  and <a href="http://blogs.egu.eu/network/palaeoblog/2015/02/03/welcome-to-the-open-glossary/">Jon
  Tennant</a> after some really useful feedback on one of our open
  science talks. It emerged we had been guilty of loading our talk
  with too much technical jargon and too much assumed knowledge for
  some of the audience, and we had failed to communicate some of the
  core ideas as a result. So we decided to do something positive about
  this and create an entry-level community-written guide to all the
  most commonly referred-to stuff in open research.
</p>
<p>
  There's no way we could have assembled all this content ourselves -
  it was a community effort. Huge thanks go to named contributors:
  Richard Iannone, Chealsye Bowley, Martin Poulter, Matt Hall,
  Priscilla Ulguim, Lou Woodley, Sibele Fausto, Nazeefa Fatima, Karen
  Cranston, Lauren B. Collister, Alasdair Taylor, Matt Menzenski,
  Patricia Herterich, and to all the countless anonymous contributors
  too! The glossary is intentionally supplied under a Creative Commons
  Zero waiver so it is completely frictionless to copy, repost,
  re-edit, remix, translate, and redistribute. Please do spread this
  around, it's there to be used.

  <p>A wordle of the glossary content. 'Open' is unsurprisingly the top word!</p>
