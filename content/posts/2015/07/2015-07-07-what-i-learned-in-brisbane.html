  Not a single negative was recorded about the people either teaching
  or helping out at the Brisbane Software Carpentry bootcamp last
  Thursday and Friday (2-3 July). There were a lot of positive
  comments though:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The workshop is great with passionate instructors
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All the helpers in the room are very helpful and fun
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Excellent support from helpers
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Instructors readily available to help especially when falling behind or [we] need help understanding codes
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
<p>
  Negative comments largely focused on pacing&mdash;a 75%/25% split
  between too fast/too slow, the sound quality (there were microphone
  issues which made it hard to hear at times especially when lots of
  people were getting help, which added to the noise), problems with
  software (surprise, surprise) , and the vagaries of wireless set up
  and connectivity. Even the room itself got a minus from one attendee
  for not being bright enough or warm enough (it is the middle of
  winter in Brisbane).
</p>
<p>
  Despite having helpers on site an hour before the workshop, we still
  had some attendees with setup issues as the first (Shell) session
  began on day one. Luckily with six helpers available, plus the
  instructors not actually teaching, there were enough supporters to
  get these people sorted while the rest of the class cracked on.
</p>
<p>
  We were lucky with our support numbers&mdash;we had six certified
  instructors attending (one of whom&mdash;me&mdash;was attending the workshop
  as a learner as well), plus six helpers, many of them Python
  experts. For all the instructors, it was their first Software
  Carpentry workshop since qualifying, so we were keen to discuss what
  worked/what didn't work so that we can do better in September when
  our next bootcamp is scheduled.
</p>
<p>
  We had a large number of women both as attendees and as instructors
  and helpers. Out of 40 attendees, 17 were women&mdash;almost half! Four
  of the six instructors were women.
</p>
<p>
  The workshop was BYO laptop. We had a mixture of operating systems
  to deal with&mdash;about a dozen Windows machines, a few Linux laptops,
  and the rest Macs. To counter issues with people not being able to
  download or open programs, we used a DIT4C container (initially set
  up by Tim Dettrick for ResBaz in Melbourne) to allow people to use
  Python, the shell, Git and sqlite3 within a Web browser. While this
  worked well for those using it, there was inevitably confusion at
  the start of sessions as people worked out which instructions to
  follow.
</p>
<p>
  The Git session attracted the most positive comments (12) and the
  fewest negatives (1). What sold people on this
  was&mdash;overwhelmingly&mdash;the provision of context. As we
  learned in instructor training, people need to know why something
  will be useful before they will invest the energy to learn it. A
  couple of attendees even wanted more Git, which is a good sign.
</p>
<p>
  Next time, we will aim to teach three things&mdash;Shell, Git, and
  either Python or R&mdash;not four. Trying to cover SQL as well was too
  much for two days, though the SQL session was very positively
  received. We did receive comments that the "program was too
  ambitious" and "too much for two days".
</p>
<p>
  Since the workshop ended, four participants (10%) have expressed
  interest in instructor training, which is great.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the participants had come prior to attending the annual UQ
  Winter School in Mathematical and Computational Biology, which
  started on 6 July. We might plan a workshop next year just for those
  attendees as we had to turn away a large number of Winter School
  people. Our bootcamp sold out very early, and we ended up with a
  waitlist of 30 people.
</p>
<p>
  For next time, we need to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Explain the etherpad more, and use it better.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Point people to the Software Carpentry lessons online, AND to
      the relevant sections of the etherpad at the start of each
      session so they can easily catch up if they get lost.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Provide more context at the start of each session.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Recap more&mdash;repetition doesn't hurt.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Get a better whiteboard.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use more diagrams to help visual learners.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Aim to have a second projection screen.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Improve the room set up so everyone is facing forward.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check that the microphones work, and preferably use mobile mikes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure we have all the right connection cables for laptop to
      projector, e.g. HDMI, VGA.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Run everything in the DIT4C container to save on set-up time and
      to provide consistency BUT help people download the software
      they will need to use post-bootcamp.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join up with the Winter School to offer a combined event, if possible.
    </p>
  </li>
