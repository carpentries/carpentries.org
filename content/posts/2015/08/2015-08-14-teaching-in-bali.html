  On July 2015, I was fortunate to receive an invitation to the first
  international workshop of the Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network
  (DIPnet), which explains the "Bali" part, in order to teach R and
  the Unix command line during the first two days. The weeklong
  workshop was co-hosted by the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology
  and Indonesia Biodiversity Research Center (IBRC), and lead by
  Dr. Eric Crandall from CSU Monterey Bay. The theme of the workshop
  was "Molecular Ecology and Bioinformatics in Developing Countries",
  which featured lectures and labs developed by the invited
  participants in their area of expertise. For this, a two-day
  software carpentry workshop was very much needed to begin the week
  and prepare all participants for the computational sessions coming
  up in the week.

  The audience was mostly faculty members and some students from
  different universities around Indonesia including Universitas
  Makassar and Universitas Negeri Papua, around half of which were
  women. Almost all attendees had little or no programming experience
  and nearly all used "not-so-good" Windows machines. To overcome this
  challenge, NERC kindly provided us with BioLinux on bootable USB
  sticks. R and Rstudio were installed separately for each
  participant. Although the ResBaz awesome cloud was made available
  for this workshop by Tim Dettrick, we didn't need to use it as
  participants preferred to have the tools installed on their own
  computers.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the workshop was a big success. Two major challenges were
  encountered in this workshop. The first challenge was the language
  barrier. As English is not the audience's main language, they
  typically find difficulty keeping up with regular conversational
  pace and unfamiliar vocabulary. That was one thing I had to be
  careful about when explaining the lessons. For this, I had to pay
  full attention to my pace, clear pronunciation of words, and
  avoiding usage of possibly unfamiliar words. In fact, in order to
  watch my pace I introduced additional sticky note colour (blue),
  which means to "slow down". They loved it! The language challenge
  was mainly why we only chose to cover the Unix Command in one full
  day, and R in another full day.
</p>
<p>
  The second challenge was making sure the audience was following up
  and understanding the material presented. The reason why this was a
  challenge is because in the Indonesian culture, it is considered
  "rude" to interrupt speakers or ask questions. Therefore, I had to
  frequently check in with them for any problems or if I needed to
  repeat something. I also constantly kept reminding them to use the
  sticky notes. After a few hours, the ice was broken and they were
  more than comfortable asking questions, requesting to repeat or slow
  down, and even making jokes.
</p>
<p>
  For the first day, we made it through most of the Bash material
  except for "Shell scripts", and "Finding things". At first, they
  were relatively slow in understanding the content, but the more we
  covered, the faster they became in understanding new commands and
  concepts. The second day, however, some found R to be slightly more
  difficult to understand than the shell. A few criticized the
  challenges as being "not straight-forward", while others felt like
  the choices of R lessons were not targeted for programming novice
  (e.g. introducing functions so early). It felt to them that lessons
  focused more on developing good programming practice, rather than
  basic knowledge of how the R language works. It was felt that the
  examples in the R lesson were somewhat abstract, especially in
  comparison to the concrete examples in the Unix lesson for how use
  of the command line could speed up processing of scientific data.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, everyone was very happy with the workshop and had lots of
  fun. They felt that they learned how to learn R/Unix. They developed
  some sense of abstract thinking. Most importantly, they now
  recognize the power of task automation and the importance of such
  skills in doing their respective research.
