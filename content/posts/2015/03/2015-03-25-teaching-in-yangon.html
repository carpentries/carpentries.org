  On Sat 7 March I spent a full day teaching a Software Carpentry workshop
  at the University of Yangon with 23 archaeologists from the Department
  of Archaeology. The workshop is part of a training component of an
  archaeological research project funded by the Australian Research
  Council, the University of Washington and the University of Wollongong.
  The group included graduate students, tutors and lecturers. Archaeology
  in Myanmar has a strong art history flavour, partly due to its British
  colonial heritage (where archaeology and art history are often paired,
  compared to the where US archaeology is usually a sub-field of
  anthropology) but mostly due to the country's extreme isolation from the
  rest of the world, where archaeology has taken a scientific turn in
  recent decades. This isolation takes several forms: travel restrictions
  that make it difficult for locals to travel overseas, and until
  recently, for foreigners to visit; small library budgets that make it
  difficult for university libraries to keep their collections and
  subscriptions current; and slow and unreliable internet connectivity
  make browsing the web, watching videos, and downloading files a lengthy,
  uncertain and frustrating process. All of this meant that the group's
  familiarity with using computers for research was lower than what might
  be expected from a Western audience, and so we adapted the SWC materials
  to accommodate this. We knew we wouldn't get through as much as a
  typical workshop, but we had the advantage of everyone starting at an
  equivalent skill level, so the sticky notes all went up and down at much
  the same time and we had a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere.

  The first major adaptation was evident right at the start: software
  installation. We had half a dozen USB sticks with the workshop files
  and R, RStudio, and Rtools installers on them, and circulated these
  around the room to get the everyone's laptop equipped for the
  workshop. This took about 30 minutes and was combined with the
  "Files and Directories" lesson (though we didn't actually use the
  shell, just discussed and diagrammed the concepts). As it turned
  out, all the laptops were running on Windows, so there was no need
  for OSX installers for R, etc. or Xcode. We were unable to install R
  on two laptops, so we discussed pair programming and rearranged some
  seating. Much of the morning was spent on the first part of
  <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/r-novice-inflammation/">the SWC R lesson</a>,
  getting used to the command line interface. We also took inspiration
  from the
  <a href=" https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/blob/master/lessons/R/00-before-we-start.Rmd">Data Carpentry lessons on R</a>,
  which are a very nice orientation for people unfamiliar with research
  software in general. Since the csv format was unfamiliar (the SWC R
  lesson starts with reading in a csv file), we also spent some time on
  the difference between closed proprietary file formats such as xls and
  open file formats such as csv. Opening a file of each type in a basic
  text editor was a nice stark demonstration of the difference (an
  activity I got from
  <a href="http://cierareports.org/blog/2013/10/18/rCourse2013/">Ciera Martinez</a>).
  We didn't follow the lesson verbatim - I used the built-in iris
  dataset but changed the names in the data to make it a fake
  archaeological dataset.  My hope was that one less element of
  cognitive overhead would make it easier for them to deal with the
  radical novelty of the read-eval-print loop of working with the R
  prompt.

  After lunch we moved to packages, R markdown, plotting and reproducible
  research. While the concepts of packages and libraries in R was only
  mildly confusing (I counted that as a successful result), our main
  challenge was getting them installed in a timely fashion. I wanted to
  use ggplot2, knitr and rmarkdown and under normal conditions would could
  get these from the internet with <code>install.packages()</code>. Knowing that any
  kind of internet bandwidth during this workshop was a bit of a roll of
  the dice, I needed a simple method of installing these packages and
  their dependencies (ie. those listed in in the 'imports' field of the
  package description) that would work without any internet connection. I
  could have just made a note of all the dependencies and manually
  downloaded their source files, but I wanted a more general solution that
  would scale up nicely, if say I wanted to 10-20 packages to install
  offline. After
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28885349/offline-installation-of-a-list-of-packages-getting-dependencies-in-order">asking around</a>
  I was recommended the
  <a href="https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/miniCRAN">miniCRAN</a> package
  (thanks <a href="https://github.com/andrie">Andrie</a>!) and used it to prepare a
  local package repository. Using miniCRAN, I got the source files of the
  packages, rather than binaries, so I didn't need to binaries for
  multiple operating systems (though, as I noted above, everyone was using
  Windows in this group). miniCRAN also took care of identifying and
  downloading all the package dependencies, which saved a lot of bother. I
  put this local repository onto my USB sticks and had everyone copy it
  from the USB sticks when they were getting the installers and other
  files at the start of the day. This was a great success, with most
  people installing the packages very quickly and easily. Only two
  students had some kind of difficulty, they worked around it by
  connecting to the internet and getting the packages online, eventually.
  Had the entire class attempted to get the packages in the usual way,
  from an online CRAN mirror, we'd probably still be there waiting for the
  downloads to finish. Although there are no doubt other solutions, I
  highly recommend local repositories with miniCRAN to anyone going in to
  a similar situation of needing to use contributed packages with limited
  (or no) internet access.

  For the afternoon session we switched from working at the R prompt to
  working in a R Markdown file, and talked about keeping a record of our
  record by saving it in a script file. For most of the afternoon we
  continued with live-coding and running code line-by-line from the R
  Markdown file, exploring the basic plot types with ggplot2 (and _not_
  qplot). Much of this was very simple and off-script from the Software
  Carpentry core R lesson (though in preparing I drew from some excellent
  SWC R lesson material online elsewhere by Jenny Bryan, Scott Ritchie and
  others). The main point was to explore different ways to visualize the
  data and learn how to interpret plots. We wrote a simple function to
  demonstrate how to repeat custom operations. We ended the day with a
  very dramatic exercise to knit the R Markdown document into a MS Word
  document. After explaining the advantage of having code and text
  contained in the same document, we all counted down together, then
  simultaneously clicked on the 'knit' button in RStudio on our laptops,
  and marveled at the creation of a Word document with text, code and plots.

  For a group with limited numerical and computational fluency, the day's
  activities was a tremendous climb up a steep learning curve. However,
  everyone enjoyed the experience and left with a favourable impression of
  scientific computing. It will probably take some more formal training
  before anyone in this group is routinely using R for their research.
  However, I think the workshop was a success communicating the basics of
  computing at the command line, using a programming language for data
  analysis and visualization, and some basic open science principles. We
  might ask what the point is of teaching scientific computing to a group
  that are so distant from the usual SWC audiences. I would say that the
  point is if we want this way of doing research -- reproducible
  transparent workflows using open source programming languages -- to
  become ubiquitous and normal, then we should embrace every opportunity
  to teach and raise awareness of it, especially among groups that are
  unlikely to hear about it from within their research community.
