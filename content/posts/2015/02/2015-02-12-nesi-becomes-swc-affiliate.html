  Partnering with Software Carpentry continues NeSI's work
  towards growing computing capability across the breadth of the New Zealand research system.
  NeSI began life in 2011 as a collaboration across five New Zealand research institutions,
  and now delivers national computational and analytics capabilities,
  both platforms and expertise,
  to research projects across the entire sector.
  With NeSI's founding in collaboration,
  the adoption of Software Carpentry fits well with the way NeSI works with researchers, institutions, and other partners,
  on advancing high tech skills, capabilities, and infrastructure.
