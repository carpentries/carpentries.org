  The most useful little guide to visualization I've ever found
  is the decision tree created by Andrew Abela,
  which you can find <a href="http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/files/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf">here</a>.
  Do you want to show a comparison, a distribution, a relationship, or a composition?
  If it's a comparison, is it among items or over time?
  Each choice leads to a different kind of plot,
  and while you may not agree with all the choices,
  it makes the reasoning behind them concrete.

  One day,
  I hope someone will turn that chart into a half-day lesson on visualization for Software Carpentry.
  Before then,
  though,
  I have a little visualization challenge that I think some of you might enjoy.
  This small data set shows population, number of workshop attendees, and number of instructors by country:
</p>
<pre>
Country,       Population,  Attendees,  Instructors

  I'd like a scatter plot comparing workshop attendees per capita to instructors per capita.
  This little Python program does that:
</p>
<pre>
import sys
import csv
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

countries = []
populations = []
attendees = []
instructors = []
with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as raw:
    cooked = csv.reader(raw)
    for (c, p, a, i) in cooked:
        countries.append(c)
        populations.append(float(p))
        attendees.append(float(a))
        instructors.append(float(i))

populations = np.array(populations) / 1e6
attendees = np.array(attendees) / populations
instructors = np.array(instructors) / populations

plt.scatter(attendees, instructors)
plt.xlabel('Attendees per million pop')
plt.ylabel('Instructors per million pop')

for (label, x, y) in zip(countries, attendees, instructors):
    plt.annotate(label, xy = (x, y))

plt.show()
</pre>
<p>
  (You can download the data and program <a href="{{ site.filesurl}}/2015/02/per-capita.csv">here</a> and <a href="{{ site.filesurl}}/2015/02/per-capita.py">here</a>,
  and yes, the CSV has all those extra spaces taken out.)
  The plot produced by this program is:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="{{site.filesurl}}/swc_blog/2015/02/per-capita.png" alt="Comparing Workshop Attendees and Instructors per Capita by Country" class="img-responsive" />
</p>
<p>
  It's not particularly useful
  (which is Canadian for "it's awful"):
  labels overlap,
  values crowd near the origin,
  and so on.
  My challenge to readers is to create something better.
  More specifically,
  add a comment to this post with your code (in any language) and a link to the picture it produces,
  and explain briefly <em>why</em> you think it's better.
  And while you're thinking about how to do that,
  have a look at Ned Gulley's <a href="http://www.starchamber.com/gulley/pubs/tweaking/tweaking.html">In Praise of Tweaking</a> &mdash;
  if there's a way to do for visualization what his programming contest does for performance,
  I'd like to give it a try.
