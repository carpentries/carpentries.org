### Thank you

#GivingTuesday, the global [“movement that unleashes the power of radical generosity around the world”](https://www.givingtuesday.org/about/) is once again upon us. We turn to you, The Carpentries community, first to thank you for all that each of you has done for The Carpentries and our global community. We always say this, and we cannot stress it enough: at The Carpentries we are all that we are because of the generous contributions of [our volunteer community members](/community/). We deeply appreciate and wish to express our gratitude often for the contributions and support we receive from our Instructors, Instructor Trainers, Lesson Developers, Maintainers, Curriculum Advisors, Lesson Program Governors, Code of Conduct Committee members, our Advisory Committee and Board of Directors, and all other members of our community. In whatever capacity you have given and continue to give to us, we thank you! 

### Support our transition to independence 

With that gratitude, we again appeal to you for your further support for [our mission and vision](/about-us/#our-vision) by donating on this #GivingTuesday any amount you feel comfortable with. Your continued generosity will support our transition to independence!

The Carpentries is in the process of [transitioning out of fiscal sponsorship](/blog/2023/08/carpentries-transition-to-independent-status/) to operate as an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation (NPO), and we are seeking donations from individuals who wish to support our desire for independence to carry out our global mission to train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. 

This move towards independence will empower The Carpentries to have greater autonomy, allowing us the flexibility to innovate, experiment, and respond swiftly to emerging trends and challenges in data science and education.

### Why donate money in addition (or as an alternative) to your time?

In her appeal to the community on #GivingTuesday last year, our Board member Sarah Stevens shared her views on why in addition to contributing to The Carpentries as a volunteer Instructor, Instructor Trainer, Executive Council (and now Board of Directors) Member, local community organiser, and Lesson Developer she also made financial contributions to the organisation. 

She wrote, “I have witnessed the funding struggles in academia related to relying on grant funding. Specifically, grants often fund novel efforts, [and] new programs the organisation is interested in pursuing. These funds do not typically fund staffing or ongoing work, which are vital for any organisation to maintain its efforts.” She then pointed out that, “This is why The Carpentries needs more “unrestricted” funding, like that available through donations, which can be allotted to ongoing activities not covered by grant funding restrictions.” Read the rest of Sarah’s appeal from last year in [Celebrate #GivingTuesday with The Carpentries Community](/blog/2023/11/celebrate-givingtuesday-with-the-carpentries/).

### Reach out to other individuals to donate to The Carpentries

You can also support our fundraising efforts by reaching out to any individuals you think might be interested in donating to The Carpentries. We have updated the [Donation Request Letter template]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/general/donation-request-resources.html) in our Handbook for you to reuse in this effort. 

We appreciate how you give to The Carpetries, and we are so excited for what the future holds for our organisation as we transition out of fiscal sponsorship into independent NPO status. We look forward to your continued support, in whatever capacity you can give, and your continued engagements with us as an independent entity! The Carpentries is and will continue to be, all that it is through your generous support and contributions.
