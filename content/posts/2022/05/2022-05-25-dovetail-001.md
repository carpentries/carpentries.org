This is the first post in a series of posts that we are calling "The Dovetail."
In this series, we aim to keep members of The Carpentries community abreast on
the current news for [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench). 

If you are interested in participating in discussions around The Carpentries
Workbench, head over to our GitHub Discussions forum: <https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/discussions>

## Updates to The Carpentries Workbench

Since 2022-05-05, 

 - [{sandpaper} version 0.5.1 -> 0.5.5](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/news/index.html#sandpaper-055)
   - This incorporates important updates for R-based lessons and introduces the `workbench-beta` config variable to indicate
     that a lesson is in the workbench beta phase
 - [{varnish} version 0.1.11 -> 0.1.13](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/news/index.html#varnish-0113)
   - Workbench beta phase alert added
   - dropdown navigation no longer is hidden by the sidebar on XXL screens (thanks [@brownsarahm](https://github.com/brownsarahm)!)
   - blockquotes are now more clearly delineated from the rest of the content (thanks [@fiveop](https://github.com/fiveop)!)
 - [{pegboard} version 0.2.4 -> 0.2.6](https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard/news/index.html#pegboard-026)
   - Link validation no longer treats `alt=""` as invalid as this can indicate [decorative images that are ignored by screen readers](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#decorative).

To update your local Workbench installation, open R and use the following code:

```r
# Enable repository from carpentries
options(repos = c(
  ropensci = 'https://carpentries.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
# Download and install sandpaper in R
install.packages(c('tinkr', 'pegboard', 'sandpaper', 'varnish'))
```

## Upcoming and Current Lessons in Workbench Beta

At the moment, we are still gathering responses from our [original call for
participants]({{ site.url }}/blog/2022/05/workbench-beta/) (if you haven't yet
signed up, you can still do so!), so there are no lessons scheduled (yet) for
transition.

### A note about the term "Workbench Beta"

I must apologise because the term _workbench beta_ is **not** the same as [beta 
stage in the _lesson development_ life cycle](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-lesson-life-cycle.html#overview-and-definitions).
Thus, whenever I refer to a lesson that is testing the beta stage of the
workbench, I will refer to it as _a lesson testing workbench beta_.

## Updates from Community About Working in Workbench Beta

 - Joel Nitta has drafted an experimental package called
   [{dovetail}](https://github.com/joelnitta/dovetail) that can facilitate
   translations of Workbench lessons. 
 - Saba Ferdous has successfully transferred a lesson that was formerly in bookdown to use The Workbench:
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LearnToDiscover?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LearnToDiscover</a> course materials are being implemented in <a href="https://twitter.com/thecarpentries?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thecarpentries</a> Workbench, which is lesson infrastructure focussed on accessibility. We are very pleased to be part of this Beta which you can learn more about in this blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKamvar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ZKamvar</a>.<a href="https://t.co/g57Yn6jQZ0">https://t.co/g57Yn6jQZ0</a></p>&mdash; Learn To Discover 🧠 (@L2D_Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/L2D_Team/status/1528699844671508480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2022</a></blockquote>



## Tips and Tricks for Using The Workbench

Need a cheet sheet for transitioning from [carpentries/styles](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example) to [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs)? Check out [The Transition Guide](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/transition-guide.html).

If you are contributing to a lesson and want to add [an instructor note](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/instructor/episodes.html#instructor-notes), 
mid-episode, you can use a fenced div with the "instructor" tag:

```markdown
::: instructor

Remember to give the learners enough time to explore their mental models!
