<p>Thanks to everyone who gave us feedback on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2010/06/concept-map.html">the first version of a concept map</a> for Software Carpentry. The second version is shown below, along with a list of terms that <em>ought</em> to be on it, but aren't. Where would you place them, and how would they connect to each other and to the concepts that are already linked?</p>
