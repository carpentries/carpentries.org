<p>As per <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2010/07/survey-results.html">your votes</a>, I'm about to start writing the lecture on version control. Our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2010/05/day-11-slides.html">first attempt</a>, two months ago, did a pretty good job of covering the basics, but the slides were downright boring. In particular, we used standard Microsoft clip art to illustrate two people sharing files via a server:</p>

<p>I'd like to use something more entertaining, like these animals from <a href="http://www.openclipart.org/user-cliparts/StudioFibonacci?page=1">StudioFibonacci</a>:</p>
<p><img title="animals" src="{{site.filesurl}}/swc_blog/2010/07/animals.png" /></p>
<p>or these Pacman-style monsters from <a href="http://www.openclipart.org/user-cliparts/nicubunu?page=19">Nicubunu</a>:</p>
<p><img title="pacman" src="{{site.filesurl}}/swc_blog/2010/07/pacman.png" /></p>
<p>If we're going to do that, though, I want to do it right, which means having at least four different characters, and some computers and stuff, seen from various angles (preferably in the isometric style, because, you know, the eighties are back in style). If you happen to have some open licensed clip art lying around, or know where I could find some, please get in touch.</p>
