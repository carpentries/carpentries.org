The past year’s Annual Report and Financial Statement are now available on the The Carpentries website. Continuing with the approach we adopted for reporting in 2023, we have dissolved the distinction between the 2024 Annual and Financial Reports and merged both into one Annual Report, accompanied by a Financial Statement. 

The 2024 Annual Report can be found on our website’s [Impact]([https://carpentries.org/reports/](https://carpentries.org/reports/)) page, and the 2024 Financial Statement is on our website's [Financials]([https://www.carpentries.org/about-us/financials/](https://www.carpentries.org/about-us/financials/)) page.

The report highlights key achievements of the Core Team and Carpentries community during 2024 and gives a snapshot of priorities for 2025. It includes a message from John Chodacki, the then-chair of our newly constituted Board of Directors during 2024, as well as a message from our Executive Director, Dr. Kari L. Jordan. 

The report also contains key financial income and expenditure data, showcasing the organisation's financial stability in fulfilling and continuing its mission. 

## Thank You

We are grateful to our Executive Director, the Board of Directors, and the Team Leads for contributing to and reviewing the report's content. 

The Carpentries would not be able to achieve all it does, year on year, without the invaluable contributions of everyone in The Carpentries community and all the organisations that support our mission. For that, we thank you with sincerest gratitude.
