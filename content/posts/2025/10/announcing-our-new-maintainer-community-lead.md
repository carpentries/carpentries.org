Hello everyone,

My name is Jose Niño Muriel, and I’m thrilled to introduce myself as your new Maintainer Community Lead, continuing [the great work Nathaniel Porter has done](/blog/2025/09/final-update-from-outgoing-maintainer-community-lead/) over the past few years.

For the last year and a half, I’ve been deeply involved with Carpentries-related activities in my role as Data Science Community Lead at the University of California, Santa Barbara Library (UCSB). There, you can usually find me organising and teaching workshops, and supporting our wonderful community of helpers and Instructors in [Carpentry @ UCSB](https://carpentry.library.ucsb.edu/).

I first learned about The Carpentries on my first day at UCSB. From that moment, I was charmed to find a community dedicated to sharing knowledge and coding, two things I’m very passionate about. Since then, I’ve been fortunate to be increasingly involved: first, by completing Instructor Training and helping with our local community; and later by collaborating with other campuses to host a University-of-California-wide week of workshops, and serving as a Maintainer for two lessons: Data Organization in Spreadsheets for Social Scientists and Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists.

As the new Maintainer Community Lead, I’m excited to support the incredible group of Maintainers who keep our open educational resources running and up to date. My goal is to help you reach the aspirations that brought you to this role, and, most importantly, to continue strengthening our sense of community. A sense of community that takes pride in contributing to our lessons and, in doing so, empowers thousands of Carpentries Instructors and learners worldwide.


I’m very much looking forward to getting to know all of you and to supporting your work in the months ahead.
