Over the past year, with support from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), The Carpentries has made incredible progress in improving [**Glosario**](https://glosario.carpentries.org/), our open, multilingual glossary for computing and data science terms.  

In [2025](/blog/2025/01/building-an-inclusive-future-in-data-science/), we focused on **making Glosario more accessible, inclusive, and community-driven**. Guided by feedback from our community, we enhanced the ways people can contribute, learn, and be recognised for their work.  

##  Join Our Final 2025 Co-Working Session  

You are invited to the [**Glosario Community Co-Working Session**](https://pad.carpentries.org/Glosario_Codefest_2024)  
🗓 **Wednesday, 5 November 2025**  
🕒 **15:00 UTC**  

During this session, we will share updates on all the work completed under the Mellon Foundation grant, including accessibility improvements and contributor recognition. This is also a space to connect, collaborate, and celebrate our contributors around the world.

##  What We Achieved in 2025

###  Expanded Accessibility and Contribution Options  
We introduced simpler ways to contribute, including a [Google Form submission process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71JUneA5XjU), an updated [Help Page](https://glosario.carpentries.org/help/), clearer contribution guides, and “how-to” videos with subtitles in multiple languages (using the YouTube autotranslate function).  

### Improved User Experience  
Navigation on [glosario.carpentries.org](https://glosario.carpentries.org/) was redesigned to make it easier to explore terms and understand related translations. We also updated visual contrast and interface elements to meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.  

### Contributor Recognition  
The integration of the **All Contributors bot** on GitHub now automatically acknowledges our 222 [contributors](https://github.com/carpentries/glosario?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors) across various roles; from translation and review to documentation and planning. These visible recognitions celebrate the many forms of contribution that keep Glosario growing.  

### New Opportunities for Feedback  
To support continuous improvement, contributors can now send suggestions directly via the [Help Page](https://glosario.carpentries.org/help/) or by emailing [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org).  


##  Looking Ahead  

As we move toward the final reporting phase of the [Mellon Glosario Supplemental Award](/blog/2025/01/building-an-inclusive-future-in-data-science/), we are deeply grateful to everyone who contributed time, expertise, and ideas to make Glosario more inclusive. Your efforts continue to shape this resource for learners and researchers worldwide.  

Together, we are building public knowledge, one translated term at a time.
