# A Message From SherAaron Hurt

Cheerfully, I get to share some exciting news! Two of our outstanding and well-deserving Core Team members have advanced in their roles at The Carpentries, Inc.

## Danielle Sieh, Workshops & Training Manager

Danielle Sieh, who joined The Carpentries in [February 2021](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/02/welcoming-danielle/) as a Workshop Administrator, has been promoted to Senior Program Manager for the Workshops and Instruction Team. Over the past year as Junior Program Manager, Danielle has showcased exceptional leadership within the Instructor community, demonstrated outstanding organisational skills in shaping content for our new website and Handbooks, and successfully managed the Self-Organised Workshops project.
In her new role, Danielle will take on additional leadership responsibilities, focusing on planning and process improvement within her areas of oversight. 
 

## Dr. Angelique Trusler, Associate Director of Community 

Dr. Angelique Trusler began her journey with The Carpentries in [November 2019](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/introducing-angelique/) as the Regional Consultant for Southern Africa. Since then, she has also served as African Capacity Development Manager and Community Manager. Now, she steps into the role of Associate Director of Community, a Junior Team Lead position.

Over the past year, Angelique has played a vital role in securing funding for The Carpentries, expanding international and regional community-building efforts, and streamlining workflows across her areas of impact. In this new role, she will lead the Community Engagement Team, overseeing strategy, management, and vision for community initiatives. She will also continue her invaluable work in supporting workshops across Africa and Europe and strengthening The Carpentries Membership program.

Supervising both Danielle and Angelique has been an absolute pleasure. I’ve witnessed firsthand their growth, dedication, and commitment to [our core values](https://carpentries.org/about-us/#our-values). They continually go above and beyond to advance our mission, and I cannot wait to see all they will accomplish in their new roles.
Please join me in congratulating Danielle and Angelique on these well-earned promotions!

# A Message from Danielle Sieh

I’m delighted to continue my journey with the Instructor Community in my new role as Senior Program Manager for the Workshops and Instruction Team. Over the past year, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside so many of you, and I truly appreciate the open conversations, valuable feedback, unwavering support, and trust. This experience has been essential to my personal growth, and I’m excited to find out where we go from here!

# A Message from Dr. Angelique Trusler

I'm excited to announce that I’m stepping into the role of Associate Director of Community at The Carpentries! I cannot wait to lead the Community Engagement Team, foster connections, and empower local and regional communities globally.

Over the years, I have been passionate about fostering collaboration, inclusivity, and accessibility within The Carpentries community—particularly in [Africa](https://carpentries.org/blog/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-africa), where we have hosted over 200 workshops, certified more than 170 Instructors in 19 countries, and expanded multilingual resources like [Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/). These efforts have been rewarding, and I am eager to build on this momentum.

I am grateful for the chance to continue contributing and profoundly thankful for the support of the Core Team and Carpentries community. I am excited to further our mission and build global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. 

Thank you all for being part of this journey—I can’t wait to see what we accomplish next!
