Between August and December 2024, The Carpentries convened a task force comprising Core Team members, community participants, and representatives from member organisations to reassess our membership model. The group explored key questions about aligning services with member needs, defining success, and balancing revenue generation with community engagement. Learn more about the task force's work in our [charter on GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/2024/membership-model/membership-model-tf-charter.md).


## Thank You

We extend our deepest gratitude to the dedicated individuals who served as task force members, sharing their expertise and valuable insights to advance our mission and the task force's goals. Their contributions have been instrumental in shaping the future of our membership model. Special thanks to Steve Diggs, Cody Hennesy, Paola Corrales, Rob Davey, Toby Hodges, Angelique Trusler, and SherAaron Hurt. Your commitment and thoughtful engagement have been vital to this effort, and we are sincerely grateful for your time and dedication.


## Developing an Equitable, Sustainable Credit-Based Model

The task force recommends developing a customisable, credit-based membership model that aligns with The Carpentries' mission to foster broad community engagement, support volunteer contributions, and ensure sustainable revenue generation. This model will introduce flexible membership tiers and resources tailored to the diverse needs of organisations and individuals, prioritising accessibility and The Carpentries' long-term financial sustainability as a non-profit organisation. A summary of the recommendations is as follows, with the [complete recommendations available on GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/2024/membership-model/mmtf-recommendations.md).



* **Recommendation 1: Rename the Membership Program to Reflect Commitment and Partnership.** Rebrand the "Membership" program to emphasise the collaborative commitment and active partnership between The Carpentries and participating organisations. 
* **Recommendation 2: Flexible Credit Packages with Mix-and-Match Options.** Offer customisable credit packages that enable members to tailor benefits to their evolving needs. 
* **Recommendation 3: Service Options for Individuals and Institutions.** Introduce service options for individuals and institutions. Provide a range of services â€”some available for free, others as a la carte or optional add-ons within the new model. 
* **Recommendation 4: Tiered Discount Structure for Loyalty and Onboarding.** Implement referral discounts where referring and referred organisations receive savings, fostering community growth. 
* **Recommendation 5: Pricing for Revenue Generation and Accessibility.** Set a competitive, income-tiered pricing model tailored to ensure The Carpentries' financial sustainability while promoting equitable access. 
* **Recommendation 6: Commitment Packages with Added Benefits.** Develop a comprehensive 'Unlimited' package for high-engagement member organisations seeking full-service access, promoting deeper integration with The Carpentries.

This year, a project team led by Erin Becker, Associate Director of The Carpentries, will begin implementing recommendations one through four. In the meantime, you can continue to count on the same high level of commitment, service, and engagement from your Core Team. We look forward to introducing a more mission-focused approach to scaling Carpentries programming across institutions worldwide!
