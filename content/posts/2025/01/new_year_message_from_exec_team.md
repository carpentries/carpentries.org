As we begin the year, we want to reflect on our journey and express deep gratitude for the collective dedication and leadership that have propelled The Carpentries forward. This post marks a significant milestone: __On February 1st, The Carpentries will become an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation!__
We have made [substantial progress across our strategic priorities](/blog/2024/12/strategic-plan-progress-and-our-path-forward/). We remain focused on finalising key projects, exploring new opportunities, and developing a forward-thinking strategic plan for 2026 and beyond. Our work is a testament to our community's thoughtful collaboration and stewardship, and we are confident it will continue to advance our mission to empower diverse communities through data and software education.


## Progress Across Our Strategic Priorities
In 2024, The Carpentries achieved significant milestones, with each step bringing us closer to our shared vision of being the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills. We prioritised building regional and local capacity to empower sustainable communities. This included finalising documentation for community roles for future badge creation, further strengthening our community's structure.
Our commitment to equity, inclusion, and accessibility has remained steadfast. We hosted a Community Session to discuss the [Toolkit of IDEAS resource](https://zenodo.org/records/10391883), an effort to further embed inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility into our work. Additionally, we wrapped up a successful six-month series of Community Sessions titled Reigniting Community, which you can find [summarised on our blog](/blog/2024/07/reflections-from-coffee-with-the-executive-director/).

## Supporting Our Volunteers and Core Team
The professional development of our volunteers and Core Team remains a central focus. Last year, we introduced [new leadership for the Instructor Trainers Leadership Committee](/blog/2024/05/trainersleadershipcommittee/), an initiative to strengthen leadership among our Instructor Trainers. Several Core Team members also participated in the CZI Open Science Training Meeting, underscoring our role in open science education.
Our curriculum development efforts have also flourished. We celebrated the [release of the new R Ecology lesson](/blog/2024/07/dc-r-ecology-lesson-redesign-released/) and [significant updates](/blog/2024/06/lc-python-update/) to Library Carpentry's Python and Data Management Plan lessons. These achievements reflect the dedication of our community members who continue to contribute their time and expertise to advance Carpentries' curricula.

## Looking Ahead
On __February 1st, The Carpentries will officially be an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation__, [a milestone that marks the next chapter](/blog/2023/08/carpentries-transition-to-independent-status/) in our [growth and sustainability](/blog/2024/02/revisions-to-the-carpentries-governance-structure/). We are excited for what this independence will enable us to achieve as we continue to serve our global community.
In alignment with our values, we will continue to advocate for equity and access to education. New resources are under development to support our advocacy efforts, and we are enthusiastic about the year ahead. 
2025 holds great promise for The Carpentries. With our global community's dedication and momentum, we are well-positioned to achieve our goals. Our unwavering commitment to inclusivity, open education, and community-driven initiatives remains at the forefront of our mission, guiding us as we navigate the evolving landscape of technology and education.

## Thank You
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all who have contributed to The Carpentries over the past year—our Board, volunteers, Core Team, and community members. Your dedication, passion, and invaluable contributions make this organisation thrive.
We look forward to a year of growth, collaboration, and impact. Together, we will continue to empower researchers, educators, and learners around the world.

__Happy New Year!__ 

With gratitude and excitement,
