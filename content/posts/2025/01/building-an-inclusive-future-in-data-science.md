[Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/), The Carpentries' open source multilingual glossary for computing and data science terms, has already made remarkable strides. By late 2024, Glosario included translations in over 26 languages, with significant contributions from our global community. However, as Glosario has grown, we have identified challenges that limit its accessibility and scalability. Contributions to the glossary, currently managed in a YAML format, can be intimidating for newcomers and time-intensive for reviewers. Additionally, we have recognised the need to provide meaningful recognition to contributors, a cornerstone of The Carpentries' commitment to valuing diverse contributions.

## The Path Forward
Thanks to early 2024 support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we updated our [Glosario contribution guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18oxYd6D9heESqw2gw9cbtxiCfkb4wlxazERFBIDCoeM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wsi1psxc3n64), uploaded an [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew1eb1ug-Q8) and [Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9K5wYq0dQM&t=17s) guide on YouTube, and made updates to enhance usability and integration to the tool. 

In 2025, with further funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we will address the challenges identified with two key goals:

- **Enhancing accessibility**: a more inclusive and UI/UX-centered approach to Glosario contributions, enhancing accessibility and engagement
- **Recognising contributors**: a recognition program to acknowledge and celebrate Glosario contributors, highlighting our community's translations as tangible achievements.

## Sustainability and Impact
Glosario will remain an open-source and community-driven resource. These enhancements will expand multilingual support and celebrate the essential contributions of our global community.
