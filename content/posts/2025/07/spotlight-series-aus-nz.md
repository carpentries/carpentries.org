The *Subcommunity Spotlight* blog series aims to raise awareness of [the many vibrant subcommunities within The Carpentries](/community/get-connected/#subcommunities) and highlight their activities. A subcommunity brings together a subset of the broader Carpentries community. It may be local (e.g., a university-based Carpentries club), regional (e.g., The Carpentries in Africa), or special interest-driven (e.g., HPC Carpentry, Carpentries-es, CarpentriesOffline). The series aims to foster connections among members, whether they live in the same region, speak a common language, or share similar interests.
To learn more or get involved in a subcommunity, join the #subcommunity channel on Slack or reach out via email at [{{< param community_email >}}](mailto:{{< param community_email >}}). If you lead a subcommunity and would like to be featured in a future edition of this series, weâ€™d love to hear from you!

## The Carpentries in Australia

The Carpentries in Australia is a regionally connected subcommunity that fosters Carpentries activity across the country, often collaborating with its counterpart in Aotearoa/New Zealand.
The Australian Research Data Commons coordinates [a national Carpentries partnership](https://ardc.edu.au/project/the-carpentries-partnership/), helping researchers rapidly build foundational data and software skills through Instructor certification. Most workshops in Australia are run by the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF), the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, and Curtin University.
