The Carpentries is evolving — and so is our membership program. To remain a strong, sustainable community of practice, we are finalising a new model that reflects today's realities, tomorrow's opportunities, and, most importantly, the needs of our community.

Last year, many of you shared your perspectives in our [2024 member survey](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/09/launching-the-carpentries-membership-program-survey/). Your feedback was invaluable — it highlighted where our membership program could be more relevant, flexible, and supportive. That input has guided our redesign, and now we're ready to take the next step.

We've developed a draft vision for the new membership model, and we want to make sure it reflects what matters most to you. Our follow-up survey focuses on specific questions that will directly influence the final design.

By sharing your thoughts, you'll help us ensure our new program is:

* **Community-centered** – built around the values and needs of our global network.  
* **Sustainable** – financially resilient and future-ready.  
* **Flexible** – responsive to the diverse contexts of the organisations we serve.

Your input now will shape the final version of our new membership program, ensuring it is truly co-created with the people who make The Carpentries what it is.
