The members of the [Board of Directors](/blog/2025/02/announcing-the-2025-board-of-directors/) held their annual retreat from 24 to 27 February 2025. With a comprehensive and well-structured agenda, the Board had time to connect and discuss our strategic planning, governance procedures, and organisational vision.

With a hybrid modality, the Board also had the opportunity to review, discuss, and make decisions about the composition and work of our standing committees while strengthening our collective purpose as a leadership body.

This was the first meeting of the Board of Directors of The Carpentries as a [501c3 non-profit](/blog/2025/01/new_year_message_from_exec_team/) organisation! 

## Goals, achievements, and highlights

The meeting's objectives included reviewing our governance structure and preparing for the transition between strategic plans. The Board received a comprehensive "State of The Carpentries" update, providing critical insights into our organisation's current position and future trajectory.

Much of our time was dedicated to our governance process and the first quarter Board of Directors, including a thorough review of parliamentary procedures for Board meetings and the structure of our meeting packets and minutes. These discussions resulted in several approved motions related to our governance processes, as the new officers and standing committees, establishing leadership roles that will guide our organisation through the coming year. 

We also had a generative discussion addressing the impact of DEI bans on our community and deciding on [The Carpentries' response to these challenges](/blog/2025/03/the-carpentries-reinforced-commitment-to-inclusion-diversity-equity-and-accessibility/). This thoughtful conversation reinforced our commitment to creating inclusive spaces for data and computational learning while navigating complex policy environments.

## Charting The Carpentries' future

As we approach the conclusion of [our current strategic plan](/about-us/strategic-plan/), the Board engaged in meaningful discussions about transitioning to our next strategic framework. The session "Reimagining The Carpentries: Meeting Today's Needs and Tomorrow's Demands" allowed us to envision how our organisation can continue to evolve while remaining true to our core mission.

Board members participated in a skill-building exercise focusing on creating effective "Carpentries pitches" \- concise explanations of our mission, vision, and impact that can be shared with potential partners, funders, and community members. This practical session equipped Board members with tools to better advocate for The Carpentries in their respective regions and professional networks.

The highlight of this work was establishing a clear timeline and process for developing our next strategic plan, ensuring continuity while embracing emerging opportunities in the computational teaching landscape.

## Strengthening the team

The retreat provided valuable time for team building and relationship development. Through structured decision-making and conflict-resolution exercises, Board members strengthened their ability to work together effectively, even when navigating complex issues.

Meeting with [The Carpentries Core Team](/about-us/team/) created important opportunities for direct interaction between governance and operations, fostering mutual understanding and alignment. These connections help ensure that strategic decisions remain grounded in operational realities.

The hybrid format allowed for meaningful participation regardless of location. This approach demonstrates our commitment to inclusive governance practices that support our global community.
