## Introduction 
Hello Carpentries community! In this blog post, we will explore how educators can effectively teach during such difficult times, drawing insights from a virtual workshop at [CarpentryCon](https://2022.carpentrycon.org/) we ran back in 2022. The challenges that Instructors are facing in 2025 are certainly different from those faced in 2022. Many of us were deeply concerned with the return to in-person activities following the pandemic-related closures. Others were embedded in discourse surrounding the 2022 presidential election in the United States. We also saw the initial outbreak of the present-day conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine. 

Each of these issues, and indeed innumerable personal events, have the potential to alter or disrupt the lives of students and Instructors alike. Indeed, additional novel challenges will undoubtedly present themselves in the future. Nonetheless, we have found that many of the lessons we learned back in 2022 have enduring implications, and we wanted to share them with you.

## Understanding Teaching in Crises  
The term "crisis" can encompass a wide range of situations, from acute events like natural disasters to prolonged challenges such as pandemics. The 2022 CarpentryCon workshop aimed to understand how these crises intersect with various teaching environments, whether short workshops or year-long courses. It emphasised the importance of recognising both the personal and professional experiences of educators and learners during these times. We provided a short explanation of what we meant when talking about teaching in times of crises, followed by breakout group discussions. There were three breakout groups, each with a different theme. One was about boundaries, and what setting, enforcing, and modifying boundaries looks like. Another was about trust, and included discussions on trust versus trustworthiness, trust in institutions, and how to build trust. The third was focused on hope, delving into the concept of critical hope, collective action and the various ways in which modelling hope is similar to other pedagogical strategies Instructors employ.

### Boundaries: Navigating Multiple Roles

One of the workshop's breakout groups focused on boundaries. Participants shared how crises often blur the lines between their professional and personal lives. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic forced many educators to balance teaching with increased childcare responsibilities due to school and daycare closures.  

The discussion highlighted the importance of establishing clear boundaries through explicit conversations and agreements. This proactive approach can prevent role conflict and emotional strain. Participants agreed that ongoing monitoring and adjustment of these boundaries are essential, especially during crises when circumstances can change rapidly.  

### Trust: Building Reciprocal Relationships

Trust is fundamental to effective teaching, particularly in crisis situations. The second breakout group explored how trust is built and maintained between Instructors, students, and institutions. Participants discussed the dual aspects of instructor trust: competence and benevolence. Demonstrating expertise in the subject matter and showing genuine concern for students' well-being are crucial for fostering trust. 

In times of crisis, transparency and clear communication become even more vital. Setting and communicating realistic expectations can help manage the inherent unpredictability of such situations. For example, Instructors should outline their availability and response times to avoid misunderstandings and frustration.  

### Hope: Cultivating Resilience and Optimism  
The final breakout group delved into the concept of hope. In the context of education, hope can be a powerful motivator for both Instructors and students. It involves a belief in the possibility of positive change and the willingness to work towards it despite challenges.  

The group discussed "critical hope," which combines optimism with a critical examination of current circumstances and a commitment to improvement. This form of hope is not about blind positivity but about recognising difficulties and working collectively to overcome them. Instructors play a key role in modelling this mindset, encouraging students to persist and adapt in the face of adversity.  

## Practical Strategies for Teaching in Crisis  
Based on the workshop discussions, several practical strategies emerged for teaching in times of crisis:

1. **Set and Communicate Clear Boundaries**: Establishing explicit boundaries between professional and personal responsibilities helps manage conflicting demands. Regularly revisit and adjust these boundaries as needed.

2. **Foster Trust through Transparency**: Clearly communicate expectations, policies, and support structures. Ensure students know where to seek help and what to expect in terms of Instructor availability and response times. 

3. **Model Critical Hope**: Encourage a balanced perspective that acknowledges challenges while focusing on collective action and achievable goals. Demonstrate resilience and adaptability, inspiring students to do the same.

4. **Prioritise Self-Care**: Recognise the importance of self-care for both educators and students. Encourage open discussions about well-being and provide resources for managing stress and maintaining mental health. 

5. **Leverage Institutional Support**: Utilise available resources such as IT support, libraries, and accessibility services. A cohesive support system can enhance the learning experience and alleviate some of the pressures on Instructors. Relying on one another is a strength.


## Conclusion  
In summary, we believe the topics of boundaries, trust, and hope all present us with the chance to reflect on teaching in times of crisis. The themes often overlapped, and we, along with the participants in the workshop, were able to connect to other pedagogical principles that we were already applying, but that took on new meanings when faced with crises. 

We also observed some themes emerge, including:   
1. Crises can lead to conflict, especially when there are big differences between our own behaviours, wants, and needs as Instructors and our employers' policies. This conflict adds an additional layer of discomfort to an already unstable situation. 

2. Clear communication is always required, and can be a great source of comfort. As Instructors, we know we cannot ignore crises when they present themselves, even if we do not know exactly what to say. Simply stating boundaries, expectations, and flexibility goes a long way to establishing trustworthiness and creating a healthy learning environment.   

3. Empathy is especially important in times of crisis. It was noted that everyone experiences crises differently, so there is not a single solution that is going to be best. Instead, aiming for flexibility is more likely to get us to actionable or ideal situations. 

Perhaps the most valuable part of this workshop was the cultivating of a sense of community. Crises are situations that feel, or are, dangerous, unstable, and uncomfortable. Running throughout all of the discussions was an emphasis on solid relationships and mutual support, which stands in opposition to the crisis. Not only was this expressed in the discussions, but it was also being demonstrated in real time as we formed connections within the CarpentryCon session!
