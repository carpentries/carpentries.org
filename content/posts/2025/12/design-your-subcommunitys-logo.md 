Dear Community,

We would like to encourage our local and regional Carpentries subcommunities that do not yet have a subcommunity logo to design one! A logo is a wonderful way for our subcommunities to visually “brand” their activities. Once designed, please share it with the The Carpentries Community Engagement Team for approval and to add it to our growing list of subcommunity logos. This, in turn, will help us visually showcase the global diversity of our subcommunities! 

## How to design your subcommunity logo

In 2022, The Carpentries adopted a [Carpentries Logo and Name Usage Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/communications/logos.html), which outlined the accepted usage and modification of The Carpentries trademarks.

The policy provides details on the contexts in which our subcommunities can use The Carpentries trademarks, as well as how they can design their subcommunity logos by modifying the Carpentries logo. 

The policy further distinguishes between uses and modifications that do and those that do not require prior approval from The Carpentries, and provides examples of correctly modified logos. 

We wish to bring this policy to the attention of our subcommunities, who often have to decide when and how to use The Carpentries trademarks within their local communities. 

Please familiarise yourself with this policy, and if you have any questions, please reach out to us at [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org).
