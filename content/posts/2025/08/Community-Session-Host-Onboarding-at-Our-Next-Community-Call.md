Are you passionate about sharing knowledge and building connections within The Carpentries community? Do you enjoy discussing open education, inclusive teaching, or community building? Are you interested in helping others learn more about how The Carpentries works and how they can get involved? Then consider becoming a Community Session Host!
Join us on **August 19 at 14:00 UTC** for our next **Community Session Host Onboarding Call**.

We are seeking community hosts to lead brief community sessions:

- **General Community Sessions**: Our community sessions cover a wide range of topics relevant to the community and can be held in various formats. Each month, the Community Development Team hosts Welcome Sessions for new community members to meet members of the Core Team and learn about ways to engage with the organisation. For example: AI Carpentry Curriculum Discussion, Lesson Contributions for Everyone - Principles and Practice, Carpentries Code of Conduct committee AMA: Questions, thoughts, ideas, worries around The Carpentries Code of Conduct or any other CoC?
- **Skill-Up Sessions**: A skill-up session provides a professional development opportunity for the community, where relevant skills are taught. For example: Creating a workshop website
- **Collaboration Sessions**: These sessions dedicate time and space to co-develop a community resource or to work collaboratively on any community activity. For example: Workbench Transition Coworking, Glosario Co-working sessions. 
- **Regional Community Calls**: These calls are hosted by our local and regional subcommunities. A list of local and regional calls can be found at the top of the Community Session Etherpad
