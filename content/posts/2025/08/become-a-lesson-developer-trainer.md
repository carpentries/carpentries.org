Do you have experience in lesson/curriculum development? Want to share that expertise with others in The Carpentries community? Interested in helping to build the Carpentries Incubator community? If so, **apply to join the upcoming round of Lesson Developer Trainer Training**!

## What do Lesson Developer Trainers do?

Certified Lesson Developer Trainers teach The Carpentries [Collaborative Lesson Development Training](https://carpentries.org/lesson-development/) to community members who want to learn how to design and develop open source lessons in collaboration with others. They lead training events and join community meetings with other Lesson Developer Trainers to discuss topics relevant to the training and lesson development in general.

Active Lesson Developer Trainers are expected to teach one to two Collaborative Lesson Development Training events (four x four hours) each year, host at least two one hour discussion sessions each year, and join monthly community calls with other Trainers. (Total time commitment approximately 30 - 50 hours per year.)

## What are the benefits of being a Lesson Developer Trainer?

1. **Learn from fellow Lesson Developer Trainers and trainees.** In addition to sharing your expertise, Collaborative Lesson Development Training events have proven to be a great opportunity to learn from the experience and perspectives of the other Lesson Developer Trainers and the trainees themselves. You find out about the lessons they are working on, their own experiences with collaboration and lesson design, and the projects and communities they are a part of. Lesson Developer Trainers regularly reflect on their own experience and provide feedback on the training curriculum and delivery.  

2. **Keep in touch with lesson development in The Carpentries community.** The curriculum development subcommunity is an exciting and thriving part of The Carpentries ecosystem. With around 200 lesson repositories currently in The Carpentries Incubator, there are a lot of great projects to learn about. By teaching Collaborative Lesson Development Training, you will support lesson developers in producing high quality lessons and working together more effectively. It is an excellent way to keep track of the projects underway in the Incubator and the lessons that are becoming available to teach. 

3. **Have fun!** Collaborative Lesson Development Training events are a lot of fun to participate in and the Lesson Developer Trainer community is friendly, welcoming, and supportive. This is a great way to connect with other enthusiastic and knowledgeable members of The Carpentries community and to grow your professional network.

## What does Lesson Developer Trainer Training involve?

The Lesson Developer Trainer Training programme consists of seven one-hour discussion sessions and associated reading tasks. We review the existing [Collaborative Lesson Development Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/) and a number of supporting resources, as well as exploring the individual perspectives and experiences of existing and incoming Lesson Developer Trainers, to ensure that all certified Lesson Developer Trainers are ready to deliver the training.

Lesson Developer Trainer Training will take place between October and early December 2025.

## Who should volunteer?

The training is suitable to anybody in the community who has experience of lesson or curriculum design. You would be particularly well suited to the role of Lesson Developer Trainer if you are familiar with The Carpentries Workbench, the open source infrastructure that our community uses to build lessons, and/or open source collaboration.

We want to hear from any community members with relevant experience and interest in becoming a Lesson Developer Trainer. Due to current patterns of demand for Collaborative Lesson Development Training, we are particularly keen to certify new Lesson Developer Trainers who can teach events suitable to community members based in the Americas (roughly, between UTC-5 and UTC-9).
