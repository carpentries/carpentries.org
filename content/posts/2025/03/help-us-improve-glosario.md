# Help Us Improve Glosario: Share Your Feedback!

At The Carpentries, we are committed to building a more inclusive and accessible world for learners and researchers working with data and computing. One of our initiatives in this effort is [**Glosario**](https://glosario.carpentries.org/), a multilingual glossary developed to help individuals understand key computing and data science terms in their preferred language.

To ensure Glosario meets the accessibility needs of our global community, we are surveying to gather feedback from current and potential users. Your insights will help us understand how to improve accessibility and enhance usability.

### **Why Your Feedback Matters**

Glosario is an open, community-driven initiative that provides translations of essential programming and data science terms across multiple languages. By participating in this survey, you can help us identify accessibility needs to make Glosario more user-friendly for diverse communities.

### **How You Can Help**

The survey should take no more than **10 minutes** to complete. Whether you are a regular user, an occasional contributor, or someone who has never used Glosario but is interested in multilingual programming and data science resources, we want to hear from you!

### **Get Involved!**

Beyond the survey, we welcome contributions from anyone passionate about making computational knowledge more accessible. If you want to contribute translations, suggest new terms, or help with development, visit the **[Glosario repository](https://github.com/carpentries/glosario)** and join our quarterly **[Glosario co-working session](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-sessions-2025)** on **7 May @ 15:00 UTC** ([Your local time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Glosario+Coworking&iso=20250507T15&p1=1440&ah=1)) to learn more.
