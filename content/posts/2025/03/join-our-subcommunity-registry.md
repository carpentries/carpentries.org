The **Community Development Program**, launched in 2022, continues to support The Carpentries’ growing network of **subcommunities** within our larger community that are local (e.g., University Carpentries Clubs), regional (e.g., Carpentries in Africa, Carpentries in the UK), domain-specific (e.g., HPC Carpentry), language-based (e.g., Carpentries-es), or interest-driven (e.g., Carpentries Offline). Subcommunities built around formal Carpentries roles (e.g., Instructors, Maintainers) fall outside this definition. 


## Join Our Subcommunity Registry!

Our community requested a **[subcommunity registry](/community/get-connected/)** that captures ongoing activities, websites, and communication channels. We are excited to announce that our **[subcommunity registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3BKF2KGPc_vv3vyuMxs8bqsSHwZvM3C1v6wXaKwVUV8rT4g/viewform?usp=send_form)** is open all year round! If you have not registered your subcommunity yet, now is the time.


### _Why Register?_


The registry serves several important purposes:

* **Increase Visibility:** Highlight your subcommunity’s mission, events, and opportunities.
* **Connect with Members:** Help others find and engage with your subcommunity.
* **Recruit New Participants:** Welcome new members who share your interests.
* **Receive Targeted Support:** Enable the Community Engagement Team to understand your needs better and offer tailored assistance.

If you have any questions about registering, please [contact the **Community Engagement Team**](mailto:{{< param community_email >}}).


## Progress on Subcommunity Support

We have made significant strides in implementing additional community-driven recommendations. Here are some key updates:


### _Quarterly Community Calls for Subcommunity Leaders and Member Organisations_


We launched quarterly calls in 2022 to provide a space for networking and knowledge-sharing. Our next call is scheduled for **[11 March 2025 at 14:00 UTC and 12 March 02:00 UTC](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-development-program)**. If you’re involved in community building, we encourage you to attend!


### _The Community Glossary and Carpentries Handbooks_


The **[Community Glossary](https://github.com/carpentries/community-engagement/blob/main/glossary.md)** is available to clarify key terms. Additionally, we redeveloped our **[Carpentries Handbooks]({{< param handbook_url >}})** as part of our website redesign. 


### _Communication Channels_


We audited our **[Slack]({{< param slack_invite >}})** and **[TopicBox]({{< param topicbox >}})** channels in 2022, and this effort is ongoing. We expanded our social media presence by adding **[Mastodon]({{< param mastodon >}})** and **[Bluesky]({{< param bluesky >}})** accounts. 


### _Event Registration for the Carpentries Community_


Want to share an event with the community? You can post in our **#events Slack channel**, submit details for our **[newsletter](/about-us/newsletter/)**, or request that your event be added to **[The Carpentries Community Calendar](/community/events/)** by [emailing the **Community Engagement Team**](mailto:{{< param community_email >}}).
