In September 2024, The Carpentries submitted a proposal to the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pose-pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems/nsf24-606/solicitation) Program. This project would position The Carpentries as a leading open source ecosystem and further solidify our independence as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organisation.

Developing a proposal of this magnitude (1.5 million USD) involved a significant amount of preparation, from conceptualisation of the idea to navigating the complex submission process. It was the first time The Carpentries did it on our own, with our Associate Director, Erin Becker, leading as principal investigator. 

After months of going through the vetting process and navigating the ever-changing landscape of scientific and research funding, we were extremely pleased to learn that The Carpentries' proposal was recommended for funding. That excitement was quickly diminished when we were notified that our proposal was flagged for DEI content, namely, for “the retention of underrepresented students, which has a limitation or preference in outreach, recruitment, participation that is not aligned to NSF priorities.” We also learned that the NSF has recently adopted [new conditions for grantees](https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/gc1-may25.pdf), including a stipulation that all new awardees certify that they “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI.” These new requirements mean that, in order to accept NSF funds, we would need to agree to discontinue all DEI focused programming, even if those activities are not carried out with NSF funds. 

Diversity is a fundamental [core value](https://carpentries.org/about-us/\#our-values) of The Carpentries. As stated in our [reinforced commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/03/the-carpentries-reinforced-commitment-to-inclusion-diversity-equity-and-accessibility/) statement, 

> “Our efforts ensure everyone, regardless of background, is equipped to promote efficient, open, and reproducible research practices. We are strengthening our organisation’s impact by cultivating an inclusive and equitable community. We remain committed to advancing our core values and mission, prioritising work that fosters inclusion, equity, and accessibility. We look forward to collaborating with funders who share our vision and are eager to support these efforts.” 

We are proud to have been recommended, and believe in the value of our proposed POSE project. However, we are rescinding our proposal and will not pursue funding through the National Science Foundation, or other US federal funding agencies with similar requirements, as long as these requirements are in place.

The work we proposed as part of our POSE project would significantly strengthen The Carpentries community by reducing barriers to entry, increasing diversity, and supporting sustained contributor engagement. With better onboarding, recognition, and a more responsive lesson development process, contributors would be empowered to engage for longer and with greater impact.

A new incubation framework would allow emerging Lesson Programs, like [the incoming HPC Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/07/hpc-carpentry-incubation-announcement/), to join our ecosystem more easily, expanding our reach across disciplines and global communities. Streamlined translation workflows would ensure lesson materials are accessible in multiple languages, supporting regional leaders in organising localised training using materials in their communities’ primary languages.

Ultimately, this work would help us avoid volunteer burnout, proactively support new community roles, and align programming with real capacity. As we grow into [our new identity as an independent nonprofit](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/new\_year\_message\_from\_exec\_team/), this funding would position us to be more adaptable, sustainable, and responsive to our community’s evolving needs.
