We are pleased to announce that our most recent cohort of Lesson Maintainers have completed onboarding and are ready to support lessons across The Carpentries curricula. 
**Thirty** new Maintainers participated in the three hour [onboarding](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/), with the following goals:

- Orientation to The Carpentries goals and vision for lesson maintenance.
- Getting connected with other Maintainers and the overall Maintainer community.
- Developing skills for creating a positive environment for all contributors.
- Becoming familiar with the key components of the lesson template.
- Practicing core technical skills for lesson maintenance.
- Learning how and when to elevate issues to the Curriculum Advisory Committee.
