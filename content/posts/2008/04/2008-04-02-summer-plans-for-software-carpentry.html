<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>
<p>The Software Carpentry site is still getting a lot of traffic, despite my neglect:</p>
<p><img src="{{site.filesurl}}/swc_blog/2008/04/usage.png" alt="Site Usage" /></p>
<p>This summer, I'd like to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert the site from static HTML pages to a wiki to make it easier for people to contribute content and fix bugs.</li>
<li>Translate the examples into <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MATLAB</a> to make them accessible to a larger audience. (Yes, <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is still my favorite language, and yes, the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> versions will remain&mdash;I just want it to be possible for the average mechanical engineer to follow the discussion of testing without first having to learn a new programming language).</li>
<li>Add some of the material that I developed for CSC301: Introduction to Software Engineering, and some of what <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog">Titus Brown</a> wrote for <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/advanced-swc/">Intermediate and Advanced Software Carpentry</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The odds of all three happening are close to zero: my grad students are going to be in the middle of real research, we're hoping to have half a dozen or ten undergraduate interns as well, we have a "<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/gwpy/practical-programming">CS-1 in Python</a>" book to finish for Pragmatic, and oh yeah, I'm getting married twice.  If you want to help out, now would be a good time to raise your hand... :-)</p>
