<p>The Software Carpentry course site is still getting a fair bit of traffic, although readership is definitely tailing off:</p>

<p>I'm hoping to run an intensive three-week version of the course in June 2009 in Toronto (details to follow); hope I can find time between now and then to finish wikifying the course notes, get the MATLAB material online, and generally freshen the site up.</p>
