  Thanks to the generous support of the Python Software Foundation,
  we will be running our biggest bootcamp ever in conjunction with
  <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/">PyCon 2014</a>
  in Montreal on April 14-15, 2014.
  We will have two rooms with seating for 50 people and two more with seating for 80,
  so our plan is to run three regular bootcamps for people of varying skill levels,
  and one more "master class" for scientists who are ready to learn more advanced topics.

<p>
  The primary audience is scientists in Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Quebec City,
  and the northeastern United States.
  We hope some PyCon attendees will sign up as well,
  but what we're <em>really</em> hoping is that
  Pythonistas will volunteer to be helpers,
  both to give learners the best experience possible
  and to give the Python community a look at what we do and how we do it.
  We'll have more details in January,
  but we're already excited,
  and hope to see many of you there.
