<p>This last Saturday and Sunday, Katy Huff and I had the pleasure of
organizing a Software Carpentry workshop at the University of Chicago.
We had 77 people attend in total and by the end of the day on Sunday
we remained 45+ strong.  (Frankly, who doesn't want to listen to me
rant about documentation at 4 pm on a Sunday afternoon?!)  This
weekend was unique in that we had a host of first time instructors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>John Blischak</li>
  <li>Radhika Khetani</li>
  <li>Patrick Fuller</li>
  <li>Jed Brown</li>
  <li>Will Trimble</li>
  <li>Sri Hari Krishna Narayanan</li>
</ul>

<p>Of note, John Blischak was an attendee of the April 2012 bootcamp
at the University of Chicago.  Cait Pickens also came up from Michigan
State University and did some extensive surveying of the students
prior- and post-bootcamp.  So be on the watch for her analysis when
it becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>Support &amp; Thanks</strong></p>

<p>One thing that made running this bootcamp significantly different and easier than
all prior workshops I have been involved in was the generous institutional support
from the <a href="http://grad-affairs.uchicago.edu/">Graduate Student Affairs</a>
office and Kalee Ludeks.  In addition to providing free lunches catered by
<a href="http://www.zhmarketcafe.com/">Z&amp;H</a> on both days, Kalee
also helped us reserve a room, contact departments and graduate
students, create a flier, and all of the other minutia that goes into
organizing one of these events.  I can safely say that without their
help, this bootcamp would not have happened!  So if you get an
opportunity, please take the time to thank them.  And, as always,
thanks again to Greg Wilson and the Software Carpentry crowd for
enabling this kind of activity.</p>
