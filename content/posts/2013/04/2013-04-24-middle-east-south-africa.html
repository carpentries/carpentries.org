  Although running a Software Carpentry Bootcamp is a rewarding experience on its own,
  sometimes we get the opportunity to get to travel somewhere really interesting as volunteer educators.
  This March,
  I put on bootcamps at the <a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut</a> in Lebanon,
  <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology</a> in Saudi Arabia,
  and <a href="http://www.sun.ac.za/">Stellenbosch University</a> in South Africa.
  For all three bootcamps,
  I taught as primary instructor, with a total of approximately 12 hours of instruction spread out over 2 days.
  I adapted content from Software Carpentry as well as
  previous classes and lectures I've taught in scientific computing, reproducibility, and software development.

  The first two workshops were taught in teaching laboratories,
  but more than half the students brought their own Linux and OS X laptops.
  I was surprised by the operating system mix at Stellenbosch University:
  almost all of the students brought Windows laptops!
  Fortunately,
  we had an almost seamless experience using Continuum's <a href="https://store.continuum.io/">Anaconda</a> package
  to provide out-of-the-box Python with NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and (of course), IPython.
  Another tool that was invaluable for me in teaching the bootcamps was <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/">Etherpad</a>.
  We created a different one for each of the bootcamps,
  and it was especially useful when students didn't have a clear view of the screen or ended up slightly behind the others.

  My advice for anybody running a bootcamp abroad is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    plan ahead, especially by installing software in teaching laboratories
  </li>
  <li>
    recruit local helpers
  </li>
  <li>
    stay flexible!
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus! Software Carpentry in the Laboratory</strong></p>

<p>
  <a href="http://empire.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Ulrich%20Buttner.aspx">Ulrich Buttner</a> and the New Microfluidics Thrust Area Lab
  brought a fun problem to work on at second bootcamp,
  taking live camera data and using image processing to translate pictures into extremely sensitive pressure measurements.
  Pictures and code from solving the problem are available <a href="https://github.com/ahmadia/actuator">here</a>.
