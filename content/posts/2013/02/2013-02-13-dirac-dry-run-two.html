Back in August we did an <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2012/08/alpha-test-of-drivers-license-exam.html">alpha test of our driver's licence</a> for <a href="http://www.stfc.ac.uk/Our+Research/24711.aspx">DiRAC</a> in conjunction with <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">The Software Sustainability Institute</a>. In the spirit of iterative development, we revised our test in light of our experiences and two weeks ago we did a 2nd dry-run. Four researchers based at University College London kindly agreed to take part as examinees, Dr. Jeremy Yates of DiRAC made the local arrangements, and James Hetherington of UCL, a newly-appointed <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme">fellow</a> of The Software Sustainability Institute, provided local assistance.
</p>
<p>
In light of the alpha test, we'd made the following changes,
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Examinees were told that they could use the web, "man" pages and any other resources a software developer uses day-to-day - we're not testing recall but assessing real working practices.
</li>
<li>
After consultation with Jeremy, we replaced Subversion with Git for the version control tasks. To avoid having to set-up examinee-specific accounts, we provided a local Git repository to examinees as part of a ZIP file containing all the exam material.
</li>
<li>
The expectation to use version control at each stage, to add answers, was made more explicit.
</li>
<li>
We added an example of a Python test function and a command-line invocation of "nosetests", for examinees that haven't written a Python unit test or used "nosetests" before.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We alloted one hour to the dry-run but, on the day, extended this to two hours. Within this time the examinees attempted all the exercises (version control, shell, automation and Make and unit testing) bar a code review exercise. Experiences and observations included:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Examinees learned what they needed on-the-fly (especially for Make and Git) looking everything up online and discussing it. The examinees felt that a primer or more preparation time would have been useful.
</li>
<li>
We allowed examinees to share hints and tips, as asking colleagues is a great way to get help. However, in the test, examinees shouldn't share the actual answers to the exercises!
</li>
<li>
We allowed examinees to write shell scripts in Python or Ruby, rather than constraining them to Bash, as we're assessing knowledge of concepts not specific tools.
</li>
<li>
A non-standard Makefile, with no default target, and a less-than-clear question meant that the Make question devoured a lot of time and had to be curtailed. While some examinees had used Make before, this had been to compile code, not to regenerate data files.
</li>
<li>
Running the test remotely is possible but examinees (and the examiner!) need a local expert in the room with them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Despite these challenges, the examinees stated that they'd learned a lot and the test was valuable in highlighting things that they didn't know. This is a very good outcome and one which we'd hope such a test would achieve.
</p>
<p>
We are now implementing changes in light of the above and will be doing a 3rd dry-run week beginning 25th February. We have also drafted a certificate which all researchers who complete the test will receive (along with a Mozilla open badge) when it goes live:
</p>

We look forward to reporting on our experiences of our next dry-run
