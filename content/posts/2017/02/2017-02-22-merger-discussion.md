Newcomers to our community frequently request clarification regarding the 
distinction between Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC). SWC 
and DC are two independently established and operated organizations that 
share a common goal of promoting education in reproducible science skills, 
both in data literacy (DC) and software development (SWC). 

Despite our separate organizational structures, SWC and DC maintain close 
ties, and have begun moving over the last year or so towards increased 
connectivity. Staff interact with leadership and members of both communities, 
and are sometimes shared hires between both groups. We offer joint 
institutional memberships. We've worked together to implement shared policies, 
and have released statements which reflect our commitment to shared values. 

Given the increasing levels of integration between SWC and DC, the SWC Steering 
Committee passed a resolution at a recent meeting to "begin discussions with 
representatives from DC leadership about a potential merger" between these two 
currently independent organizations. 

We are excited about the potential these discussions hold in forging a strong, 
cohesive community that will continue to promote the goals of both organizations, 
and look forward to sharing our ideas with you in coming months.
