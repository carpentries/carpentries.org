We are pleased to announce the publication of
"[Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)"
by Greg Wilson, Jennifer Bryan, Karen Cranston, Justin Kitzes, Lex Nederbragt, and Tracy K. Teal,
which is intended as a complement to 2014's
"[Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)".
As the summary says:

> Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most
> researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for
> research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can
> take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how
> effectively they can work with software and data. Computing
> workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and
> notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project
> structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing
> often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good
> computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of
> their current level of computational skill. These practices, which
> encompass data management, programming, collaborating with
> colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing
> manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from
> our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that
> have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.

We hope the community will find it useful,
and would welcome feedback.
