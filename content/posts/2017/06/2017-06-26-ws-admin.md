With the growth of Carpentry workshops all over the world, we are excited that Maneesha Sane is moving from Program Coordinator to Program Manager of Software and Data Carpentry. As Program Manager, she will continue to be involved in workshop coordination and instructor training and will oversee and ensure the quality and consistency of program operations.

To fill some of her workshop coordination responsibilities, Software and Data Carpentry are looking to hire a **part-time Workshop Administrator** to help set up workshops and ensure that they run smoothly.

The successful candidate will join a team of workshop coordinators around the world. In this job, you will manage workshop logistics, 
help communicate with hosts and instructors, and respond to general workshop inquiries.

work independently. Strong attention to detail is a must. Enthusiasm for our mission of teaching people how to program is also a plus!
