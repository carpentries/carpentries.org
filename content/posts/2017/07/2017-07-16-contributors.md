In 2016, Software Carpentry instituted a twice-yearly release schedule for our lessons 
(see [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/previous/) for previous releases). 
Lesson releases, representing a snapshot in time of the material's development, are 
published through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) 
and given a DOI for citation purposes. Releases serve a few 
purposes, primarily to provide a trackable record of the development of our materials and 
to allow attribution to community members who contribute to lessons. The lesson 
maintainers are included as editors, while all other contributors who have made changes 
(as tracked through GitHub) are represented as authors. 

Given that the time is approaching for a new release, we have begun to reassess how to 
manage the rather lengthy list of authors for each lesson. Rémi Emonet designed and 
implemented a fantastic automated method for lesson releases for Version 2017.02 in 
February 2017. We would like to improve this process by including additional information 
about our contributors besides their names. Zenodo allows inclusion of an ORCID 
identifier for each author, which provides a more robust and trackable method of 
identifying authors than traditional affiliations. If you're not familiar with ORCID, 
please head over to their [website](https://orcid.org) to learn more and obtain your own 
identifier. ORCID is a great project which would be certainly useful outside of this 
purpose!

A second issue related to lesson authorship is that our list of authors is inherently 
additive in nature, and represents anyone who has authored commits merged into the 
lessons. As our lessons have matured, some contributors no longer desire to be included as 
an author on the release. There are multiple reasons why this might be the case. For 
example, someone may no longer be affiliated with Software Carpentry, or may have authored 
a commit early in the lesson development process that does not currently appear in the 
lessons. We have operated under the philosophy that the lessons as they currently exist 
are the cumulative result of all previous work, and all authors should be  acknowledged. 
However, we also recognize that this is ultimately a personal choice, and our community 
members should be allowed to opt-out of authorship in all future releases if they wish.

To reconcile these two issues, we've decided to gather some information from our 
contributors using [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/xfx2DIDpkf5Z8DeH3). If you have 
contributed to lessons in the past, please take a few minutes to provide some basic 
information. We will be collecting responses until August 1 to include in the next 
release, although the form will stay open indefinitely. Eventually we may decide to add 
features in AMY to capture this information, but for now, 
please help us test this approach by [adding your 
information](https://goo.gl/forms/xfx2DIDpkf5Z8DeH3).
