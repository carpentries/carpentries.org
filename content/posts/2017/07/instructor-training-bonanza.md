The [Carpentry Instructor Training curriculum](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/) helps prepare new instructors to teach Carpentry workshops. It 
also impacts instructors' teaching practices when they teach in other contexts, helping to spread the 
Carpentry pedagogical model and evidence-based teaching practices around the world!

We last published this curriculum in [February](https://zenodo.org/record/278229#.WWUUZtPyuEI). Since then,
we've taught over 150 new instructors at a dozen training events. We've also welcomed ten new Instructor 
Trainers to our community, with fifteen more to join in September. We've learned a lot over the past six months and want to incorporate what we've learned before our next
publication (scheduled for August 10th). Please join the Trainer community in updating these lessons!

# Get involved!  
If you’ve made a contribution to the Instructor Training materials, you’re already an author. Help make 
sure the final product is polished and complete by getting involved in the lesson release events. 

The Instructor Training Issue Bonanza is starting Thursday, 
July 13th at 22:00 UTC and will continue until Friday, July 14th 22:00 UTC. Click [this link](https://tinyurl.com/yazoyg6k) to see the event in your local time.
 
# How does the lesson release process work?   
Here’s a run-down of the lesson release process and our timetable for this release.  
- Issue Bonanza to identify issues that need to be fixed before publication. **July 13-14**  
- Staff and maintainers organize issues (e.g. add tags and remove duplicates). **July 16-20**  
- Bug BBQ to fix issues identified during Issue Bonanza. **Aug. 3-4**  
- Publish! **Aug. 10**  

Issues to focus on are in the 
[lesson release checklist](https://github.com/datacarpentry/lesson-release/blob/master/release-checklist.md). 
You don’t need to be an expert in the materials - we need people to help search for broken links 
and typos too!

If you’re planning on joining the Issue Bonanza - add your name to the [event Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-training-issue-bonanza). 

We’re excited to work with the community to update these materials. Put these dates on your calendar, and we’ll 
send out reminders and updates too. These lessons belong to the community - help us keep them great!
