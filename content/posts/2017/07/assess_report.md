We've begun to look at our pre- and post- workshop surveys and are sharing the draft reports to stimulate conversation about 
our workshops and their impacts on learners. For this first cut, we looked at our post-workshop survey data. 

From this survey data, we can see that learning to program can be quite intimidating for many learners. 
About 44.5% of Software Carpentry learners who responded to the post-workshop survey feel that at least one of the tools 
covered in the workshop they attended was either slightly or very intimidating to them before attending a workshop. 

Luckily for our learners, we have trained, enthusiastic, and considerate instructors who are great communicators. 
As a result, our learners are leaving Software Carpentry workshops with increased confidence and motivation to perform 
computing tasks like initializing a repo in Git and importing libraries in R or Python!

We have learned so much from the analysis of our post-workshop surveys. We invite you to check out 
the **Analysis of Software Carpentry's Post-Workshop Surveys** [report](https://carpentries.github.io/assessment/learner-assessment/software-carpentry/postworkshop/2017-July/2017-July-post.html) 
to learn more. Special thank yous go to Ben Marwick, Naupaka Zimmerman, Erin Becker, and Jonah Duckles. 
These individuals made valuable contributions to the code that was used to create the figures in this report.

All of the data are available in a de-identified way in [this repository](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/tree/master/learner-assessment/software-carpentry/postworkshop).
