Writing a blog post should not be hard. A blank screen can seem very daunting, but if you populate it with a few questions, 
such as Who? What? Where? When? Why? and How?, then you have the genesis of a post. 

Workshop report? Once you've answered the questions above, you're pretty much done. Throw in something that went well or 
a funny story about something that didn't, and that's it.

Conference reportback? Ditto. Project you're working on? Ditto.

Perhaps you've stumbled across some new tool that you love so much you want to tell the world? 
Tell us why you like it and what you use it for, and that's a post right there.

If you are not sure how to format your post for our blog, check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md), 
which now includes instructions on posts.

If that all seems too hard, feel free to email your text to [me](mailto:bweaver@carpentries.org), and I will arrange to post it for you.

We want our blog to be useful to our community, and a multiplicity of voices helps with that.
