My favorite tool is [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

Emacs provides an extensible and unified framework to access nice interfaces to several other tools. 
For instance, it allows you to:

- Keep notes, maintain `TODO` lists, plan projects, edit and automatically export documents to many formats (Org-mode).

- Conveniently edit Python source code and, at the same time, send code regions to a Python shell, permitting a 
piece-by-piece interactive programming (Python mode).

- Make the GDB debugger a user-friendly and effective tool when programming in C++ (GUD mode).

- Use Git through a beautiful interface ([Magit](https://magit.vc/)).

- Edit [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) files through sophisticated packages that synchronize the text buffer with a PDF viewer, 
pretty-print mathematical expressions directly in the text buffer, automatically handle references and 
much more ([Auctex](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/)).

- Access a handy but powerful LISP interpreter anytime from any text buffer.
