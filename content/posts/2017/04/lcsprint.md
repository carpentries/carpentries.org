Lesson maintenance is necessarily an ongoing task, especially with fledgling lessons where workshops taught 
reveal gaps or issues with existing material. Development of new lessons 
may also spring from the same source. Who *hasn't* thought, after teaching: "Wouldn't it be great if we could add *x*?"

But lesson maintenance and new development are probably best done as a shared activity, which is why the Library Carpentry community
has signed up to work on lessons intensively during the 2017 [Mozilla Science Lab global sprint](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/) 
on 1-2 June. Check out our [sign up etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc2017) for information about our plans.

This is a call for librarians - and archivists too - to join the sprint. You don't need to
be a coder to help out. Perhaps you can be a site host - finding a room for people to work together. Or maybe you have ideas
about what should be tackled, or even a scenario or a dataset that could be used in a workshop. 

Perhaps you have a task you have always wanted to automate? Or maybe there is something about how you work that
frustrates you? Chances are that other people find the same snags in what they do, and would welcome a new
way out of that frustration maze.

Ideas are gold for sprinters, so we really welcome ideas on what to teach and how to teach it. 

At this stage, we plan to work on consolidating our SQL and web scraping lessons and building a new Python lesson. We would also 
welcome input on our more established lessons such as [Data Intro](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-data-intro) 
and [OpenRefine](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-openrefine). [See the full list here](https://github.com/data-lessons). 

How can you get involved?
 
- Join the [sprint](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc2017) - even if only to say hi or suggest things we should do (we love feedback)
- Add to the issues we are tackling [here](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/librarycarpentry.github.io/issues/23) 
- Pop into the [chatroom](https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry) and tell us what you want/don't want
- Publicise the sprint in your library or workplace
- Encourage people to join us for some or all of the sprint
- Follow Library Carpentry on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry) and help spread the word.

So far, we have five sites committed to host people working on the sprint - two in the UK, one in Australia, one in 
the Netherlands and one in the US but we are hoping Canada, South Africa and New Zealand will make it eight 
(and there is always room for more). 

People are also signing up to work remotely, which is good as we are seeing new people joining up. 

Please get on board !
