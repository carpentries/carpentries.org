<p><b>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry website.</a></b></p>

One of the issues that we have with the
[styles](https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles),
[lesson-example](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example), and
[workshop-template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template)
repositories is that some issues or pull request just sit around
for a long time because of the lack of ownership of those repositories.
Going on with the [Proposal for Lesson Infrastructure Subcommittee](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/issues/155),
that will try to solve that issue,
we would like to announce that Subcommittee calendar for 2017.
