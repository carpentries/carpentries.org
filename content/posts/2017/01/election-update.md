# 2017 Steering Committee elections and January Community Call

We are pleased the announce the 2017 Steering Committee elections, which will occur from January 23-27. All members will receive a ballot via email to cast their vote via [electionbuddy](https://electionbuddy.com). Be sure to look at the [membership list](https://software-carpentry.org/scf/members/) and [let us know](mailto:admin@software-carpentry.org?subject=SCF%20membership) if you feel you've been left off by mistake; membership details are [here](https://software-carpentry.org/scf/).

## Community Call

As a preface to the election, we are using our [January Community Call](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-01-19) to allow the candidates time to introduce themselves. We have seven outstanding candidates to fill the seven Steering Committee seats. Our governance rules require us to hold the election, albeit uncontested, but we also feel this is a vital way for the community to exhibit commitment to the organizational leadership. Please [sign up](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-01-19) to attend one of two meetings on January 20 to hear about our candidates' plans for 2017. What would you like to see the Steering Committee accomplish? What are you excited for Software Carpentry to tackle this year?
