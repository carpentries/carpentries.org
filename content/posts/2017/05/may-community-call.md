The Software Carpentry Steering Committee (SWC SC) announced 
[back in February](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/02/merger-discussion.html) 
that we were initiating discussion with Data Carpentry about potentially merging into a 
single organization. Members from the SWC SC and the Data 
Carpentry Board have been meeting regularly since then, identifying the advantages and 
logistical challenges associated with a restructured organization. More recently, we 
passed a motion approving the following structure: "A Carpentry umbrella organization 
and a set of Lesson Carpentries. The umbrella organization is primarily responsible for 
finances, administration, and facilitating policy. Each Lesson Carpentry is primarily 
responsible for lesson development and maintenance." 

This motion represents the first step towards a restructured Carpentries organization, 
with the respective community governance structures continuing to solidify details over 
the next few months. We are excited to share our vision and goals with you during the 
May Community Call. Mark your calendar for May 18 and sign up on the 
etherpad [the etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2017-05-18)!
