Also, there's this [thing at UCLA](https://ucla-data-archive.github.io/2017-09-08-ucla/) going on September 7-8 ...

Greetings, my [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io) community peeps! 
Hope your summer is going as well as mine, which means about as fine as the coffee in *Twin Peaks*, 
or a Fellini film - take your pick.

Several months ago, I wrote [a post](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/05/lc-Portland-Boston.html) about the amazing time I 
had in Portland at [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com/) and at the 
[Library Carpentry Instructor Training](https://weaverbel.github.io/2017-05-04-portland-ttt/) that [Belinda Weaver](https://twitter.com/cloudaus)
and [Tim Dennis](https://twitter.com/jt14den) taught, 
ably assisted by [myself](https://twitter.com/JulianeS), [John Chodacki](https://twitter.com/chodacki) and a spatula. 
We had a wonderful cohort of instructors-in-training, all of whom I know would rock a room with their Bash 
and OpenRefine instructional skills.

So I say to thee, oh [#porttt cohort](https://twitter.com/hashtag/porttt?src=hash), if you haven't completed the final steps of 
your instructor certification, get on it, because we need you! 

Remember how much fun we had in Portland? 

You can have that again, by holding your own Library Carpentry workshop and building your local community of data-savvy colleagues. 

### Steps to [certification](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/):

#### 1. Contribute to a lesson. 

Library Carpentry just had a [very successful writing sprint](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/06/lc-sprint.html), and 
we have a lot of open issues to resolve so there are 
many opportunities to contribute, even if it is spelling corrections or link updates. 
The downside of this is that it can be confusing to figure out *HOW* to do this and what issues are actually available to work on. 
If you find it daunting to know where to start, or how to get through the GitHub workflow, 
please - PLEASE - contact [me](mailto:Juliane_Schneider@hms.harvard.edu), [Tim Dennis](mailto:tdennis@library.ucla.edu) or 
[John Chodacki](mailto:John.Chodacki@ucop.edu) and we'll help you through it.  Promise, it's eezee peezee!

#### 2. Participate in an online discussion.

This is the easy one. Jump online and hang out! Ask questions about doing workshops, ask about specific lessons, 
or, like me, have an ecstatic geekfest discussion about the glories of [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/), in my case with 
[Kate Hertweck](https://twitter.com/k8hert). 
Here's the [schedule](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion). 

[Sign up for a session](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion) and knock this one 
off the certification list. 

#### 3. Teach a short demonstration session.

This is easier than you think. (*LOUD WHISPER*: you are on videoconference doing live 
coding/demo, so you can use notes and nobody sees you looking at them!) We are mostly nice people, 
except for me when when confronted by MARC XML or a poorly made gimlet. 
So, you will be fine ... unless you do something outlandishly egregious, like perhaps 
saying "just" a lot or admitting out loud that you didn't like OpenRefine.

[Sign up for your demo](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/teaching-demos). 

That's it!

--------

If you want what I just typed in more formal and less metricious language, see 
the [full checkout procedure](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/).

I know, it's SWC, but we're following the same procedure, so you are in the right place.

Now. NOW. To the fun part.

### Team Spatula Returns! 

Belinda, Tim, John and I will be at UCLA September 7-8, spreading the word about Library Carpentry and having discussions 
about community building and running a [Library Carpentry workshop](https://ucla-data-archive.github.io/2017-09-08-ucla/)
(or watching some of our new instructors teach one, we hope). In addition, we will be having yet more fabulous times 
after hours with all of our new best Library Carpentry friends.

As we finalize the schedule for this reunion event, we'll keep you all informed, 
and remember, if you are experiencing any kind of roadblock or confusion over your final LC instructor certification steps, 
please contact one of us. We will be more than happy to help you complete the steps and start planning a workshop!  

(*Hint*: if you are still completing certification and are in the LA area and want to get certified in time 
to be an instructor for the September 7-8 event, we'll help you get there, and get you your first instructor experience.) 

Basically, if you need any support, **PING US**.  We are are here to help.  And we hope to see some of you soon in Los Angeles.	

Till next time, 

Juliane
