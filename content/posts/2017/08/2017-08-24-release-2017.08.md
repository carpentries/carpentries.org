We are pleased to announce the latest publication of Software Carpentry lesson materials, 
from release Version 2017.08. Although most of our lessons are fairly mature, we had  
almost 100 new contributors. We have used this 
opportunity to improve the process through which lessons are released, some parts of 
which were previewed in this [blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2017/07/contributors.html). 
This release includes linked ORCID identifiers (visible on the Zenodo page next to 
the author's name) and has allowed for individuals to opt-out as contributors. 
You can learn about the release process on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/swcarpentry/swc-releases), and can view this and previous 
archived versions on the [release page]({{site.baseurl}}/lessons/previous/).
