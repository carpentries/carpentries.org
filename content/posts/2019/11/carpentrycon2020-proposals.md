CarpentryCon is one of the most awaited events of The Carpentries for community building and networking. The theme for CarpentryCon 2020 is “**Growing inclusive, computational communities and leaders.**” This three-day event brings together new and experienced community members to share knowledge, network, develop new skills, and exchange strategies for building local communities of practice.  The conference will be at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, USA from 29 June to 1 July, 2020. Come and help develop the next generation of leaders through practical skill-ups, networking, workshops, and breakout sessions. 

We invite you all to submit proposals to share your knowledge and skills to help enhance research, learning outcomes, and productivity across the board for librarians, scientists, and technologists from various domains. The Taskforce has developed an enriching program with ample opportunities for networking, learning, and discussions on The Carpentries’ experiences within our diverse community. 

A proposal in the context of this conference is a formal written suggestion to host/run a session at the conference. #CarpentryCon2020Madison will have three types of sessions described here later. The proposed session should be a blend of lecture and interactive learning. The Taskforce will provide the necessary classroom space and, depending on need and availability, supplies for workshops, breakout sessions, and skill-up sessions. 

**Breakout sessions (1 hr)** -  discussion sessions on specific topics (for example Burnout, Python, Open Science, Science communication, Leadership). <br/>
**Skill-ups (1 hr)** -  more specific sessions aimed at sharpening skills around specific tools like Git, Python, and R. <br/>
**Workshops(~3 hrs)** -  interactive Carpentry-style sessions.<br/>
