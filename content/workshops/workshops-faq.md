## Pre-Workshop Questions

{{< accordion title="When planning workshop, how closely does the workshop have to stick to the Carpentries lesson plans??" >}}

Centrally-Organised workshops must teach the Core Curriculum of a lesson plan. Visit our [Curricula Overview page](/lessons/curriculum-summary/) to learn more about what we have to offer!
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Should the Instructor or a member of the host institution be listed as the contact person on the workshop webpage?" >}}

The contact person for the workshop webpage can be designated by the workshop organiser. The person listed should be knowlegdable about the workshop so they can answer questions regarding the workshop such as attendance policy, waitlist, location, installation, etc. You can have multiple persons listed as the contact person if needed.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Where do I find the pre/post survey for the learners to use?" >}}

The learner facing survey links are automatically generated on the workshop's webpage. Generally, they will be located directly above and within the schedule. You are welcome to share the survey links (located on the workshop webpage) with your attendees whenever the time is right for your workshop.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do I access the survey results?" >}}

If you are planning a workshop, please notify the Workshops and Instruction Team of your planned workshop using the [workshop request form]({{< param amy_workshop_landing >}}). The Workshops and Instruction Team will send the link to view results of the survey one to two weeks prior to the workshop. If there are more than 10 survey responses, you will have the option to download the survey data, using the "Download CSV" link at the bottom right of the survey results page.

## Centrally-Organised Workshops

{{< accordion title="What is a Centrally-Organised workshop?" >}}

A Centrally-Organised workshop is organised in collaboration with The Carpentries. The Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) will locate Instructors, set up registration, and provide additional support during the workshop planning process. There is an administrative fee associated with Centrally-Organised workshops.
Please visit our [host a workshop page](/workshops/host-workshop/#host-a-workshop) to learn more about Centrally-Organised workshops.

[Resources for hosting a Carpentries workshop]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/workshops/checklists.html) can be found in the Carpentries Handbook.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How much does a workshop cost?" >}}

Please visit our [pricing page](/support/pricing) for more information.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Do Instructors pay for travel?" >}}

Our Instructors are volunteers and are not paid for their time teaching. Therefore, we ask the host to cover travel and accommodation costs for Instructors assigned to teach at your institution. We work to find local Instructors but suggest that you estimate about $3000 total ($1500 per Instructor) for the travel, food, and accommodation of the Instructors. **Note travel and accommodation costs might vary globally.**

The details of how you will manage the Instructors’ travel is discussed once the Instructors are confirmed and introduced to the host. *The Carpentries is not involved in this process.*
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Who can be a helper and what do they contribute to the workshop?" >}}

Helpers are often recruited from the local community at the host site to support Carpentries workshops. Helpers support learners one-on-one if they are stuck installing software, understanding a certain line of code, or any other parts of the learning process. [Here]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/workshops/checklists.html#helper-checklist) is more information regarding helpers.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Are helpers reimbursed for travel?" >}}

The Carpentries is not responsible for selecting helpers. This is the responsibility of the host organisation. It is the discretion of the organisation if they would like to reimburse the helpers for travel. [Here]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/workshops/checklists.html#helper-checklist) is more information regarding helpers.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How soon can I request a Carpentries workshop?" >}}

The Carpentries workshops are offered on-demand, not on a set schedule. We ask for a minimum of two to three months lead time to organise the workshop. If a request is less than two months, there will be no guarantee that we will be able to provide Instructors for your workshop. Please be advised that a workshop will not be scheduled until it has been confirmed by the host and The Carpentries Workshop Administrator. Our workshops are organised based on the order the Workshop Request Form is received and finalised. 
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="My currency is not USD, will I get invoiced in USD or my local currency?" >}}

If your organization does not accept invoices in USD, please let us know. The Workshops and Instruction Team will connect you with the Management Team, who will work with you in coordinating invoicing. To keep workshops accessible, The Carpentries will take responsibility for standard fees that arise due to an organisation’s location outside of the US. We see this as a good business practice within a global community.

## Online Workshops

{{< accordion title="I have never hosted an online workshop, where should I begin?" >}}

Hosting an online workshop for the first time can be daunting. We have many great blog posts written by the community that you can reference to help with planning. 
[The Software Sustainability Institute's Guidance for Running Online Training](/blog/2020/07/software-sustainability-institute-online-training-guidance/) has 
tips and tricks for everything from preparing your agenda to managing breakout rooms and advice on how to set up your workspace. Visit our [Resources for Online Workshops]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/workshops/resources_for_online_workshops.html#resources-for-online-workshops) in our handbook for additional resources. 
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Does my online workshop have to be two full days?" >}}

We understand that eight-hour days can feel long in an online setting. To make things more manageable, your workshop can be split into alternative formats: three 5-hour days or four 4-hour days. Please choose the schedule that works best for you and your learners!
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Will I be provided with a Zoom room to run my online workshop?" >}}

For Centrally-Organised workshops, if your institution has a videoconferencing platform available, we recommend that you use that platform for The Carpentries workshop. This will reduce the time needed for workshop organisers and learners to learn a new system. However, if you do not have access to a video conferencing platform, we will be able to provide you with access to one of our Zoom rooms.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How many Instructors will The Carpentries recruit to teach my online workshop?" >}}

The Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) will always recruit at least two Instructors for any workshop that you plan, online or in person. Because online workshops can be more challenging than workshops that are in person, WIT will recruit up to two additional Instructors for online workshops. Additional Instructors are dependent upon Instructor availability. 
{{< /accordion >}}


{{< accordion title="What are the roles of everyone participating in a workshop?" >}}

*Instructor*: A person who has been certified by The Carpentries and understands best practices as outlined by The Carpentries curricula. These persons will lead the workshop and teach the scheduled lessons.

*Helper*: A person who is familiar with the topics being taught at a workshop. They support learners one-on-one if they are stuck installing software, understanding a certain line of code, or any other parts of the learning process.

*Learner*: A person who is attending the workshop to learn the material being taught.

*Workshop organiser/host*: The person who requested The Carpentries workshop. This person is the main contact for the workshop and will be able to provide logistical support for attending the scheduled workshop.
{{< /accordion >}}

## Miscellaneous

{{< accordion title="What happens if I need to cancel or postpone a planned workshop?" >}}

**If you need to cancel your workshop**, please be sure to inform the Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) by emailing [{{< param workshops_email >}}](mailto:{{< param workshops_email >}}). The WIT member that you have been working with will ensure that the workshop is removed from The Carpentries website and complete any other administrative tasks associated with the workshop.

**If you need to postpone your workshop**, please email [{{< param workshops_email >}}](mailto:{{< param workshops_email >}}) and the WIT member that you have been working with will help you select new dates for your workshop and complete any other administrative tasks associated with the workshop.

*Please ensure that you inform your registrants of a canceled or postponed workshop via email or through your registration platform.*
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="What is the difference between a Centrally-Organised workshop and a Self-Organised workshop?" >}}

For a Centrally-Organised workshop, The Carpentries Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) will recruit Instructors, set up registration, and provide additional support while planning workshops. There is an [administrative fee](/support/pricing) for Centrally-Organised workshops. A Self-Organised workshop is planned independently of WIT, which means the host is connected with our [certified Instructors](/community/instructors/) and will work with them on all aspects of workshop organisation. Self-Organised workshops are free of charge. Please visit our [Host a Workshop](/workshops/host-workshop/) page to learn more about both workshop types. 
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="How do I get survey data/links for previous workshops?" >}}

The Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) can provide survey result links for past workshops (August 2018 - present) to Instructors and hosts affiliated with the workshop, or a member contact affiliated with the host organisation. To request survey results links, please send an email to WIT (via [{{< param workshops_email >}}](mailto:{{< param workshops_email >}})) with your request and include a link to the workshop website(s) and/or slug(s).
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Can we restrict who participates in our workshops?" >}}

Yes, it is up to the workshop organisers to decide who can attend a workshop. You can open it to the public or restrict it to people from your organisation. When you [request or register]({{< param amy_workshop_landing >}}) your workshop, you can indicate whether or not it is open to the public.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Are there email templates available for me to locate helpers?" >}}

We have compiled several [email templates]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/workshops/email_templates.html) to help you respond to various groups: participants, Instructors, and helpers.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Can I charge Learners a fee to attend a workshop I host?" >}}

Yes, you can charge learners a fee to attend a workshop. Often a nominal fee of $20 reduces the number of no-shows. Many workshops have a waitlist, so it is best to be able to offer open seats due to no-shows to people on the waitlist instead of having an empty seat.
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion title="Can I pay Instructors a stipend?" >}}

The Instructors selected to teach workshops are volunteers and are not paid for their service. To compensate for their time, we require the host to cover travel expenses. If you would like to support our Instructors, you are encouraged to make a targeted [donation]({{< param donation_form >}}) to The Carpentries to support instructor development.
