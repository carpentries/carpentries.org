## Workshop Curriculum

* [Data Carpentry workshops]({{< param dc-website >}}/lessons) are for people who work with data in their research and want to learn how to code and organise their projects to work more effectively and reproducibly with data. 
* [Library Carpentry workshops]({{< param lc-website >}}/lessons) are for people working in library- and information-related roles to build software and data skills. The workshops are domain-agnostic, though the datasets used will be familiar to library staff. 
* [Software Carpentry workshops]({{< param swc-website >}}/lessons) are for people who are learning to develop software or want to learn best-practices in software development. Lessons are domain-agnostic, and teach the Unix shell, coding in R or Python, and version control using Git.
