## Workshop Curriculum

The Carpentries has three official lesson programs, each providing lessons catered to a specific audience or purpose. Our workshops may focus on lessons from one set of curricula or mix and match lesson's to provide the audience with an experience catered to their needs.

Our lessons teach  Unix shell, coding in R or Python, version control using Git, and OpenRefine,

Depending on the lesson, exercises can be generic and for anyone wanting to be more comfortable with coding, and may include datasets that will be familiar to librarian or teach how to use code to work more effectively and reproducibly with data with lessons based in Astronoomy, Ecology, Genomics, Image Processing and Social Sciences.
