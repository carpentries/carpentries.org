## Workshop Curriculum

* [Data Carpentry workshops]({{< param dc-website >}}/lessons) are for people who work with data in their research and want to learn how to code and organise their projects to work more effectively and reproducibly with data. 
* [Library Carpentry workshops]({{< param lc-website >}}/lessons) are for people working in library- and information-related roles to build software and data skills. The workshops are domain-agnostic, though the datasets used will be familiar to library staff.
