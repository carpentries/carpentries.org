## Host a workshop

We have two options for hosting a Carpentries workshop; Self-Organised and Centrally-Organised.

A **Self-Organised workshop** is a Carpentries workshop where the registration, recruitment of Instructors, and preparation for the workshop are managed by the host. Self-Organised workshops are free of cost to organise and allow for planning in a way that is more catered to the needs of the host and learners. While the majority of planning is dependent on the host and learner needs, we do have a few guidelines that we ask our Self-Organised workshop hosts to follow:
* Our motto is “never teach alone.” We ask that each Carpentries workshop have a minimum of two Instructors and that at least one of the Instructors teaching a Self-Organised workshop is Carpentries certified. 
* The Carpentries workshop website is an important part of our processes and workflows. Please use the [Carpentries template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) to create the workshop website. This helps us ensure your workshop is entered into our database correctly, allows us to display your workshop on our [upcoming workshops page](/workshops/upcoming-workshops), and assists us in supporting you and your team with workshop surveys and follow-up.
* Learner surveys help you, your Instructors, and the Core Team better understand the [impact of Carpentries workshops](/about-us/impact/#other-impact-reports). All workshops should utilise the pre and post-workshop surveys that are created automatically on the workshop website.
* We love to know about Self-Organised workshops! [Register]({{< param amy_reg_sow >}}) your workshop with us to give your Instructors credit, receive the responses to the learner surveys, and help us learn the full [impact of Carpentries workshops](/about-us/impact/#other-impact-reports).

A **Centrally-Organised workshop** is an integrative approach to planning a Carpentries event. Collaborate with the Carpentries Workshops and Instruction Team (WIT) to organise your workshop and a member of WIT will do the work to prepare your team for an exceptional workshop experience. Preparation from WIT includes recruitment of certified Instructors, setting up and providing access to Eventbrite for learner registration, arranging a virtual meeting space for online workshops when needed, and a wealth of resources and information to ensure a successful workshop. 

Once confirmed, WIT will introduce you to your team of Instructors who will work with you to create a schedule and get to know your target audience. Instructors assigned to your workshop will also ready a website to supply you and your learners with the information needed to prepare for the workshop. With the assistance of WIT and your Instructors, a Centrally-Organised workshop is a great way to meet all of your workshop needs!

To learn more about organising a Carpentries workshop, please visit [The Carpentries Handbook]({{< param handbook_url >}}/resources/workshops/).

## Curriculum Requirements for Centrally-Organised Workshops 

Centrally-Organised workshops must teach a lesson program’s core curriculum and can not be mixed with components from another lesson program’s curricula. Below, you will find the workshop requirements for each lesson program:

* A [Library Carpentry]({{< param lc-website >}}) workshop should include any three lessons from the Library Carpentry curriculum  

* A [Software Carpentry]({{< param swc-website >}}) workshop should include The Unix Shell, Version Control with Git, and a programming language (R or Python)  

* A [Data Carpentry]({{< param dc-website >}}) workshop will vary based on its specific curriculum. It should generally include a lesson on one programming language (either R or Python) where applicable, as well as all other lessons outlined in the curriculum.

## What to Expect After Requesting a Workshop

Once you have requested your workshop, you can expect the following:
* **Review of request**: the member of WIT who is responsible for workshops in your region will review your request and follow up within 10 business days 
* **Date confirmation**: workshop dates will be confirmed no less than eight weeks before your workshop starts 
* **Instructor Recruitment**: we will inform our certified Instructors that a new teaching opportunity is available eight to ten weeks before the workshop (time is dependent upon finalisation of workshop dates)
* **Instructors Connected**: we will confirm Instructors at least four weeks before the start of the workshop. Because our Instructors are volunteers, there is sometimes a delay in recruiting Instructors. If this happens, we will let you know at least four weeks before the start of the workshop so that alternative options can be discussed
* **Workshop**: Instructors will join you and your learners to teach a hands-on, data skills and coding workshop at your organisation!

## Workshop Pricing 

Consult our [pricing page](/support/pricing) for our current fee structure.

## Travel Expenses for Instructors

Carpentries Instructors are volunteers and are not paid for their service. To compensate Instructors for their time teaching, we require the host to cover expenses for travel, food, and accommodation for in-person workshops. To minimise expenses, we prioritse local Instructors when recruiting. However, we recommend estimating $3,000 total for expenses ($1500 per Instructor). Once the Instructors and workshop dates are finalized, you will work with them directly to plan travel, accommodations, and reimbursements.
