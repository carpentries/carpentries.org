The Carpentries Workbench is a open-source and portable lesson infrastructure built with the R programming language.
We aim to provide a robust software framework so the Carpentries and its community is able to freely build reliable, stylish, and accessible online learning materials.

All our lessons across our lesson programs, including those in development in the Carpentries Incubator and Lab, are built using the Workbench.

We welcome contributions to the Workbench so please do connect with us over on GitHub!
